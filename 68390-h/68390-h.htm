<p>... <span class="allsmcap">And this is the story I told you through the
several nights: of the man who came up through
the dark and the fighting (often in such a ruck
of fighting that he couldn’t hear voices); how
he was punished by men, broken by self, and healed
by a woman; indeed, but for her, he might have
chosen the long way of the brute to put on his
powers and attain the certain royalty of the
human adult in this year of our Lord. She paid
the price; she was the man-maker; she saw the
World-Man shining ahead.... It is a story of
the path at our feet, of the Compassionates who
draw near to speak, when we are brave enough to
listen, of the women who walk beside us. A tale
of the road as we go&mdash;many are ahead, many behind&mdash;but
we do not travel this stretch again.</span></p>

<p class=" ph2 nobreak" id="KAO_LIANG">KAO LIANG</p></div>

<p><i>No one thought of kao liang.</i></p>

<p><i>Morning did not mention it in his great story; even
Duke Fallows did not think of it.</i></p>

<p><i>Kao liang, the millet of China. Inland seas of it are
there, green in the beginning of its flow, dull gold in its
high tide.</i></p>

<p><i>A ruffianly scouring grain. Rice is its little white sister.
Millet is the strength of the beast, the mash of the
world’s poor. A hundred millions of acres of Asia are
in yield or waiting for kao liang to-day. Remember the
poor.</i></p>

<p><i>In Manchuria kao liang grows strong and high. Its
fox-tails brush the brows of the tall Chinese of the north
country. It brushed the caps of the Russian soldiers
one certain Fall.</i></p>

<p><i>The Censurer came with the planting in that year. Kao
liang was like a soft green mould upon the hills and valleys
when he came to his battle-fields. He was watching
for a browner harvest and a ruddier planting. Fall
plowing and red planting&mdash;for that, he came to Liaoyang.</i></p>

<p><i>His soldiers trampled it, devastated the young grain with
their formations, foraged their beasts upon it. Yet the
millet grew, hardened and covered the earth&mdash;for the
poor must be served. Out of flood and gale and burning,
it waxed great, filling the hills and the hollows, closing
in on the city, climbing thinly to the Passes.</i></p>

<p><i>Its protest to the invasion was mute as China’s, but it
did not run. Before the Japanese, it closed in. It was
ripe when the brown flanker crossed the Taitse. It
was ripe when two Slav chiefs took their thousands forth
to form the anvil upon which the flanker was to be
broken. The Cossacks had been feeding their beasts
upon it for many days, and they drank in the deep hollows
where the roots of kao liang held the rain. It was
ripe for the world’s poor, when the Sentimentalist strode
forth at last&mdash;the hammer that was to break the spine
of the flanker.</i></p>

AFIELD</h2></div>

<p class="ph3">1</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> town of Rosario was ahead. The cavalry expected
to sup and sleep there. Chance of firing
presently from the natives was pure routine. John
Morning, back in the second troop, on the horse of a
missing soldier, wondered if years of service and exploration
would make him ever as great a correspondent as
Mr. Reever Kennard looked. The wide, sloping shoulders
of the Personage were to be seen occasionally when
the trail crooked, far forward and near the General.</p>

<p>The bit of fighting was over before the rear troopers
got rightly into the skirmish-line (every fourth trooper
holding four horses); and now the men breathed and
smoked cigarettes in one more Luzon town; and another
<i>Alcalde’s</i> house was turned into headquarters....
This was a brigade expedition of December, 1899. Two
weeks before the General had ridden out of Manila.
Various pieces of infantry had been left to garrison the
many towns which would not stay held without pins.
Two or three days more, then Batangas, and the big ride
was over, the lower Luzon incision complete, and drainage
established.</p>

<p>Morning, with the troopers, had to look to his mount
in regulation fashion, and did not reach Headquarters
until after the others. The <i>Alcalde’s</i> house in Rosario
as usual stood large among the straw-thatched bamboo
huts. The little upper room which Morning had come to
expect through the courtesy of the staff, was easily
found. The saddle-bags and blanket-rolls of Mr. Kennard
and his companion, a civilian, named Calvert were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>already there, each in a corner. Morning’s thought was
that he would hear these men talk after supper. In a
third corner he placed his canteen, and shyly tucked away
in the shadow, the limp haversack.</p>

<p>There was a small table in the room, of black wood
worn shiny by the hands of the house, as the black wood
of the floors was worn shiny by the bare feet of servants.
Upon the table was a small sheath-knife, the brass handle
of which was inscribed <i>Mio Amigo</i>.</p>

<p>It becomes necessary to explain that the human male
is discriminating about his loot, by the time he has been
afield two weeks in a tropical island, especially if he has
camped in a fresh town every night. The day’s march
makes him value every pound that he can throw away,
for he has already been chafed by each essential button
and buckle. A tin pail of silver pesos unearthed in a
church had passed from hand to hand among the soldiers.
As the stress of the days increased (and the artificial
sense of values narrowed to the fundamentals such as
food and tobacco and sleep), Morning had observed with
curious approval that the silver hoard leaked out of the
command entirely&mdash;to return to the natives for further
offerings to the priests.</p>

<p>So the knife on the table aroused no desire. It was
not even a good knife, but <i>Mio Amigo</i> took his eye, as
if affording a bit of insight to the native mind. It could
not have been wanted by Mr. Kennard or Mr. Calvert,
since it lay upon the table. Morning put it in his coat,
knowing he would toss it away before to-morrow’s sun
was high. In his hot moist hand the brass-handle sent
up a smell of verdigris. A little later in the village road,
he encountered Mr. Reever Kennard in the act of purchasing
ancient canned stuff from a native-woman, too
lame to run before the cavalry. Morning was not natural
in the Presence.</p>

<p>The great man was broad and round and thick. He
criticised generals afield, and in Washington when times
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>were dry. He had dined with the President and signed
the interview. His head dropped forward slightly, his
chin sunk in its own cushions. He bought the native
wares with the air of a man who is keeping a city in
suspense, and the city deserves it. Morning stood by and
did not speak. There was no reason for him to stay;
he did not expect companionship; he had nothing to say;
no money with which to buy food&mdash;and yet, having established
himself there, he could not withdraw without remark
of some kind. At least he felt this; also he felt
cruelly the cub. He was at home in this service with
packers and enlisted men, but always as now, officers,
and others of his own work, made him feel the upstart.</p>

<p>Mr. Kennard now turned to perceive him, his eyes
opening in the “Bless me&mdash;what sort is this?” manner of
the straying Englishman; and John Morning, quite in a
funk, fell to enforcing an absurd interest in the native
sheath-knife. Kennard was not drawn to such a slight
affair, but perceiving the menial in Morning, allowed
him to carry some of his purchases back to Headquarters.</p>

<p>Supper was a serious matter to the boy. He had no
money nor provisions. In the usual case, money would
have been no good&mdash;but there were a few things left in
the shop of the lame woman. The field ration was light;
and while he would not go hungry if the staff-officers
knew, it was a delicate matter to make known his grubless
state. Morning rambled over the town, after helping
Mr. Kennard to quarters, and returned empty to the
upper room. Mr. Calvert was there and appeared to see
Morning for the first time. Calvert was a slender quiet
chap, and believed in what he had to say.</p>

<p>“Where did you get that little sheath-knife you
showed Mr. Kennard?” he asked abruptly.</p>

<p>Morning sickened before the man’s eyes. His life
had been fought out in dark, rough places. He was as
near twenty as twenty-five. He had the way of the
under-dog, who does not expect to be believed, looking
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>for the worst of it, whether guilty or not. He told Calvert
he had found the knife on this table.</p>

<p>“I thought I put it in my saddle-bags,” Calvert said.</p>

<p>“You are very welcome to it. The <i>Mio Amigo</i> made
me look at it twice&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That’s why I wanted it. Take this for your trouble.”</p>

<p>Calvert placed a bit of paper money on the table between
them.</p>

<p>“It was no trouble. I don’t want the money.”</p>

<p>“Take it along. Don’t think of it again.”</p>

<p>Morning didn’t want to appear stubborn. This was
the peculiarity of the episode. The thought of taking
the money repelled him. The connection of the money
with supper occurred, but not with the strength of his
dislike to appear perverse or bad-tempered.... He
saw all clearly after he had accepted the paper, but the
matter was then closed. He was very miserable. He had
proved his inferiority. The little brush with big men
had been too much for him. He belonged among the
enlisted....</p>

<p>He went to the lame woman and bought a bottle of
pimientos and a live chicken. The latter he traded for
a can of bacon with a soldier.</p>

<p class="ph2">2</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">I</span>mperial Hotel</span>, Tokyo, early in March, 1904....
The Japanese war office had finally decided
to permit six American correspondents to accompany
each army. The Americans heard the news with gravity.
There were two men for every place. Only three Japanese
armies were in conception at this time. The first
six Americans were easily chosen&mdash;names of men that
allowed no doubt; and this initial group, beside being the
first to take the field, was elected to act as a committee
to appoint the second and third sets of six&mdash;twelve places
and thirty waiting. The work at hand was delicate.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span></p>
<p>The committee was in session in the room of Mr.
Reever Kennard. Five of the second list had been settled
upon when the name of John Morning (of the Open
Market) was brought up. It was Duke Fallows of San
Francisco, who spoke:</p>

<p>“I don’t know John Morning, but I know his stuff.
It’s big stuff; he’s the big man. We’ve gone too far without
him already. He has more right to be on the committee
than I. He was here before I was. He has
minded his own business and taken quarters apart. I had
no intention of breaking into the picture this way, but
the fact is, I expected John Morning to go in first on the
second list. Now that there is only one place left, there
really can’t be any doubt about the name.”</p>

<p>Mr. Reever Kennard of the  <i>World-News</i> now arose
and waited for silence. He got it. The weight of Mr.
Reever Kennard was felt in this room. Everything in
it had weight&mdash;saddle and leggings of pigskin, gauntlets,
typewriters, cameras, the broadside of riding-breeches,
and a little arsenal of modern inventions which
only stop firing upon formal request. Without his hat,
Mr. Reever Kennard was different, however. Much
weight that you granted under the big hat, had left that
arid country for the crowded arteries of neck and jowl
and jaw, or, indeed, for the belted cosmic center itself.
He said:</p>

<p>“Mr. Fallows talks wide. This Morning is out on a
shoe-string; and while he may have a bit of force to handle
certain kinds of action, it isn’t altogether luck&mdash;his
not getting a good berth. The young man hasn’t made
good at home. He hasn’t the money backing to stand
his share of the expense. The War Office suggests that
each party of correspondents employ a sutler&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Fallows was still standing and broke in:</p>

<p>“I’m interested in that matter of making good at
home. I’ve seen the work of most Americans here, and
I believe John Morning to be the best war-writer sent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>out from the States. As for the shoe-string, I’ll furnish
his tooth-brush and dinnercoat&mdash;if the sutler insists&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“We understand very clearly the enthusiasm of Mr.
Fallows who wants a second column-man for his paper.
Doubtless this Morning is open&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I hadn’t thought of it, but certainly the <i>Western
States</i> would profit, if John Morning turned part of his
product there. How about your <i>World-News</i> on that?”</p>

<p>“I favor Mr. Borden for the sixth place in second
column,” Kennard said simply.</p>

<p>“Borden reached Tokyo three weeks after Morning&mdash;and
never campaigned before.”</p>

<p>“He’s one of the best of the younger men in New
York&mdash;a Washington correspondent of big influence&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I have no objection to him, except as one to take the
place that belongs to John Morning. I can’t see him
there.”</p>

<p>Kennard looked about him. Morning was not well
known, having been little seen at the <i>Imperial</i> in the last
six weeks. Fallows had not helped him by saying he
was the best war-writer sent out from the States; still
in a general way he could not be put aside. Kennard
saw this.</p>

<p>“I wasn’t going to hurt Morning badly, if I could help
it,” he said, “but Mr. Fallows has rather forced it. This
Morning isn’t straight. We caught him stealing a
sheath-knife from the saddle-bags of Archibald Calvert
down in Luzon four or five years ago. Morning said he
found it on a table in the room assigned to us. He took
money from Calvert for restoring the knife.”</p>

<p>Fallows laughed at this.</p>

<p>“I can’t believe the story,” he said. “The man who
did the stuff I’ve read, isn’t stealing sheath-knives from
another’s saddle-bags.... Oh, I don’t mean that it
didn’t seem true to you, Kennard&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Kennard had waited for the last, and was not good
to look at until it came. He turned quickly to the others.
Borden was chosen.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span></p>
<p>“You’ve still got a place to fill in the first list,” said
Fallows.</p>

<p>The committee was now excited. The five faces
turned to the Westerner.</p>

<p>“I repeat, Kennard, that your remarks may be within
the letter of truth, but I wouldn’t campaign in the same
army with a man who’d bring up a thing like that against
a boy&mdash;and five years afterward. Understand, I have
never spoken a word to John Morning&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You’re not giving up your place?” said the committee.</p>

<p>“Exactly.”</p>

<p>“Then you’ll take Borden’s with the second&mdash;&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“I have nothing against Borden. I wouldn’t spoil
the chance of a man already chosen.”</p>

<p>“Then first with the third army,” urged the committee.</p>

<p>“I can do better than that,” said Fallows. “Gentlemen,
I thank you, and beg to withdraw.”</p>

<p class="ph2">3</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">J</span>ohn Morning</span> waved back the rickshaw coolie at
the door of the little Japanese Inn, where he had
been having his own way for several weeks, and walked
down the Shiba road toward the <i>Imperial</i> hotel. He had
half-expected to get on the committee, which meant work
with the first army and a quick start; failing in that, he
looked for his name to be called early in the second list,
and was on the way now to find out. Morning shared
the passion of the entire company to get afield at any
cost.</p>

<p>Reasoning, however, did not lift his restlessness and
apprehension. He had not been on the spot. He had
been unable to afford life at the <i>Imperial</i>; and yet, the
costliness of it was not altogether vain, since the old
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>hotel had become a center of the world in the matter of
war-correspondence. Japan reckoned with it as the point
of foreign civilian force. While his brain could not organize
a condition that would spoil his chance, Morning’s
more unerring inner sense warned him that he was
not established, as he walked in the rain.</p>

<p>His name was not posted in any of the three groups.
The card blurred after his first devouring glance, so that
he had to read again and a third time. For a moment
he was out of hand&mdash;seething, eruptive. Yet there was
nothing to fight....</p>

<p>Corydon Tait, a young Englishman with whom he
had often talked and laughed, was standing by. Tait’s
name was not down. Morning controlled himself to
speak courteously.</p>

<p>The Englishman looked beyond him at the card. A
chill settled upon Morning’s self-destructive heat. This
was new in his world. In the momentary misunderstanding,
he grasped Tait’s arm.</p>

<p>“Really, old chap, I’d prefer you not to do that,” the
other said, drawing his arm away. “It must be plain
that I don’t know you.”</p>

<p>“I thought you were joking,” said Morning.</p>

<p class="ph2">4</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">B</span>ack</span> on Shiba Road in the beginning of dusk, he
turned to the native inn. The door slid open before
his hand touched the latch; his figure having been
seen through the papered lattice. The proprietor bowed
to the matting and hissed with prolonged seriousness,
hissed in fact until the American had removed and exchanged
his shoes for sandals. The hand-maidens appeared
and bowed laughingly. The old kitchen drudge
emerged from her chimney and ogled. The mother of
the house took the place beside her lord on the rostrum-of-the-pencils.<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
She did not hiss, but it was very clear
that the matting under the white man’s feet was far
above her in worthiness.</p>

<p>There was something of this formality with his every
entrance. Morning had felt silly during the first days
as he passed through the hedge of bent backs; the empty
cringing and favor-groveling had seemed indecent. But
now (in the dusk of the house before the candles) a
faint touch of healing came from it. They had all served
him. He had been fearfully over-served. They had
bothered his work through excessive service&mdash;so many
were the hands and so little to do. The women were
really happy to work for him. To-night, a queer gladness
clung to their welcome. He had fallen indeed to
sense it. He was starving for reality, for some holy
thing. They had stripped him at the <i>Imperial</i>. In his
heart he was trying to make a reality now of this mockery
of Japanese self-extinction.</p>

<p>The bath-boy, wet from steam, with only a loin-cloth
about him, followed Morning to his room. The American
was not allowed to bathe alone; would not have been
allowed to undress himself, had he not insisted upon the
privilege. He sat in a tub, three walls of which were
wood and the fourth of iron. Against the outside of
the latter, burned a furious fire of charcoal. For the
benefits of this bath, he was begged to make no haste
and to occupy his mind with matters of the higher life.
A moment or two before the water reached a boiling-point,
Morning was allowed to escape. Exceeding pressure
of business was occasionally accepted as precluding
the chance of a bath for one day, but to miss two days
in succession, without proving that he had bathed elsewhere,
meant a loss of respect, and a start of household
whispering.</p>

<p>He was sick to get back to work, turned to it for
restoration and forgetfulness, as a man to a drug. Moreover,
there was need, for he was on space. Two or three
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>papers in the Mid-west used what he could write, though
he had no holding contracts, and had left Chicago with
such haste to catch a steamer, that there had been no
chance to make an arrangement, whereby these papers
might have used the same story simultaneously. And
then, there had been a delay of nearly a day in Vancouver.
This time in Chicago would have been enough
for the establishment of a central office and an agent on
percentage, who could have enlarged his market without
limit, and cut down his work to one letter a day. Instead,
he did the same story now, from three different
angles. It had been this way before. With war in the
air, Morning was unable to breathe at home. Off he
went, without a return ticket&mdash;tourist cars and dingy
second-class steamer passage&mdash;but with a strange confidence
in his power to write irresistibly. It was like a
mark&mdash;this faith of his in the ability to appeal.</p>

<p>All his life he had lived second-class. To-night he
wondered if it would always be so; if there was not
something in the face of John Morning, something that
others saw at once, which placed him instantly among
culls and seconds in the mysterious adjustments of the
world. They had made him feel so at the <i>Imperial</i>, before
this episode. Men who didn’t write ten lines a day
were there on big incomes; and others, little older than
he, with only two or three fingers of his ability, on a
safe salary and flexible expense account.</p>

<p>The day was brought back to him again and again.
The cut of Corydon Tait had crippled him. He felt it
now crawling swiftly along the nerves of his limbs until
it reached his brain, and remaining there coldly like undigested
matter in a sick body. He felt his face queerly.
There was neither fat nor flabbiness upon it. He could
feel the bone. His fingers brushed his mouth, and a sort
of burn came to him. It was the finest thing about John
Morning. There was a bit of poetry about it, a touch
of tenderness, finer than strength. Passion was in the
mouth, intensity without intentness, not a trace of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>boarish, nor bovine. It is true you often see the ruin
of such a mouth in quiet places where those of drugs
and drinks are served; but you see as well the finished
picture upon the faces of those men lit with world’s
service, who have heard the voice of the human spirit,
and are loved by the race, because they have forgotten
how to love themselves.</p>

<p>Morning knew it only as his weakness. It was the
symbol to-night of his failure.... Those at the
<i>Imperial</i> had seen it; they had dared to deny him because
of it. The greatest among the war-men were thin-lipped
and sinewy-jawed&mdash;the soldier face.... He knew
much about war; none had campaigned more joyously
than he. In the midst of peril, courage seemed altogether
obvious and easy; his fearlessness was too natural
for him to be surprised at it, though it surprised
others....</p>

<p>The typewriter buzzed on. Wearily he caught up the
trend, but the drive was gone, although there was hardly
a lull in the registering of the keys for two-thirds of a
page. Always before, this sort of hackwork had been
done with a dream of the field ahead. His forces
fused. He had been denied a column. His hand
brushed across his face and John Morning was ashamed&mdash;ashamed
of his poverty, of his work, of his own nature,
which made a tragedy of the cut of Corydon Tait;
ashamed of the heat in his veins from the stimulants he
had drunk; ashamed because he had not instantly demanded
his rights at the <i>Imperial</i>; ashamed of the mess
of a man he was, a fool of his volition and vitality, commonness
stamped on his every feature.</p>

<p>Morning’s affinity for alcohol was peculiar. He
worked with it successfully. So resilient was his health
that he was usually fresh in the morning. Often he
had finished a long evening of work on pretty good terms
with himself, the later pages of copy coming in a cloud
of speed.... The copy-producing seemed to use
up the whipping spirit, rather than himself; at least, he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>treasured this illusion. The first bottles of rice-beer
lasted the longest.... He recalled now that the
maid-servants had twice heated <i>sake</i> for him at supper;
as for the rice-beer he had been more than ever thirsty
to-night. He glanced into the corner where the bottles
were and a sense of uncleanness came over him&mdash;as if
his body were flowing with the slow spirit, like a sea-marsh
at high tide.</p>

<p>... He heard the shafts of a rickshaw grate upon
the gravel outside. Amoya had come; it was midnight.
He opened the papered lattice. The runner was bowing
by his cart, holding his broad hat with both hands.
Morning covered his machine, put fresh charcoal in the
brazier, caught up his hat and overcoat, and shuffled
down the stairway, holding his slippers on with his toes.
The door-boy gave him his shoes and opened the way
to the street. Morning greeted Amoya with a pat on the
shoulder, and climbed into the cart.</p>

<p>“Yoshuwara?” the runner asked.</p>

<p>“No, you shameless ruffian!”</p>

<p>“No?” Amoya squeaked pleasantly.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;not&mdash;no must do.”</p>

<p>Morning waved his arm, signifying solitary and
peaceful enjoyment of the night air and contemplation
of the dark city. These night journeys had become the
cooling features of his day. Amoya was a living marvel,
the rickshaw runner incomparable&mdash;tireless, eager,
very proud of his work; too old to be spoiled. He was
old; indeed, enough to be Morning’s father, but his limbs
were young, and his great trunk full of power unabated.</p>

<p>The night was dark, damp, no moon nor star. The
cold which was almost tempted thinly to crust the open
drains, was welcome to the man’s nostrils. Amoya
warmed and gathered speed. Up the broad Shiba Road
he sped, past the far dim lights of the highway, past
Shiba temple, the tombs of the Ronins, past the cavalry
barracks (by far the best joke on Japan), and the last of
the known land-marks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>

<p>Now Morning suffered strange temptations. Few
white men who have lived any time in Japan have escaped.
A Japanese house with every creature comfort
was within his resources even now; wholesome food,
<i>sake</i>, rice-beer were cheap; excellent service, even such
service as Amoya’s was laughably cheap. Why not sink
into this life and quit the agony?... Why did he
think of it as <i>sinking</i> into this life? Why did he agonize
anyway?... There was always a fresh sore on him
somewhere. Surely other men did not burn back and
forth every day as he did.</p>

<p>The shame came again. He ordered Amoya back
within an hour, left him at the door of the Inn, drenched
with sweat and delighted with his extra fare.</p>

<p>Morning slid open the door of his room. Nothing
could be seen but the glow of the brazier, yet he knew
some one was within.... A series of mattresses
and robes had been taken out from a chest of drawers
and made up on the matting. The women as usual, had
waited for him to go out. He lit the lamp.</p>

<p>A little Japanese maid-servant was curled up asleep
at the foot of his bed. Morning sat down upon the
cushion and mused curiously.... It was thus that
Naomi had ordered Ruth to steal into the couch at the
feet of Boaz. Ruth had found a home, and was not
long allowed to make herself glad with mere gleanings....
It was this sort of thing that made Morning hate
Japan. In the eyes of the old, limp-backed Inn-keeper,
this child was a woman. He would not have dared to
delegate a mere maid-servant to ply the ancient art with
his guest, but there were extenuations here: the delicacy
and subtlety of the little one’s falling asleep, and the
child-like freshness of the offering. It was this last that
stung Morning, because he knew the old Japanese found
a commercial value in this very adolescence.</p>

<p>He had smiled at this child during the day, and asked
her name&mdash;Moto-san&mdash;and repeated it after her, as one
might have done the name of a child. She had just come
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>in from the fields, reported the bath-boy who preëmpted
any leakage of English whatsoever, and who was frequently
on the verge of being understood.... Her
hands showed labor, and she was not ashen as the Japanese
beauties must be, but sweet and fragrant&mdash;and so
little.</p>

<p>“It is the same the world over, when they come in
from the fields,” he said. “Good God, she ought to be
sleeping with her dolls.... Poor little bit of a girl
in a man’s country ... and they sent you in here to
keep me from night-riding. One cannot complain of
hospitality ... Moto-san... Moto-san....”</p>

<p>She stirred, and snuggled deeper. “She is truly
asleep,” he thought.</p>

<p>“Moto-san!” he said softly again.</p>

<p>The girl opened her eyes, which suddenly filled with
fright. Morning patted her shoulder gently. And now
she sat up staring at him, and remembering.</p>

<p>He leaned his head upon his palm and shut his eyes&mdash;sign
of falling asleep&mdash;then pointed her to the door....
Morning could not tell if she were pleased. It all seemed
very strange to her&mdash;her smile was frightened. He repeated
the gesture. She had slid off the bed to the matting
upon her knees, facing him. And now she bowed
to the floor, and backed out so, bowing with frightened
smile.... He reflected dismally that she had lost
value for the eye of the Inn-keeper.</p>

<p class="ph2">5</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">M</span>orning’s</span> idea as he reached the <i>Imperial</i> next
forenoon was to call the committee together, or a
working part of it, and to demand why he had been barred
from the projected columns.... The high and ancient
lobby was practically empty. It appeared that the
correspondents <i>de rigeur</i> and <i>en masse</i> were posing for
a photograph on the rear balcony, which was reached
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>through the billiard room. Morning went there and
stood by the window while the picture was taken. It required
an hour or more. He was passed and re-passed.
Two or three Americans seemed on the point of asking
him to take his place with the fifty odd war-men, but they
checked themselves before speaking. Morning felt vilely
marked. Stamina did not form within him. He did not
realize that something finer than physical courage was
challenged.</p>

<p>He watched the backs of the formation&mdash;the squared
shoulders, the planted feet. He knew that in the minds of
the posing company, each was looking at his own. From
each individual to his lesser or greater circle, the finished
picture would go. It would be reproduced in the periodicals
which sent these men&mdash;“<i>our special correspondent</i>”&mdash;designated.
Personal friends in each case would choose
their own from the crowd. The little laughing chap in
brown corduroys who arranged the group was the best
and bravest man in field photography. He left the camera
now to his assistant, and took place with the others.
Men of twenty campaigns were there. The dim eyes of
a certain little old man had looked upon more of war than
any other living human being. In one brain or another,
pictures were coiled from every campaign around the
world during the past forty years. Never before in history
had so many famous war-men gathered together. It
would be a famous picture.... He, John Morning,
would hear it in the future:</p>

<p>“... Why weren’t you in that picture?”</p>

<p>“I sat in the billiard room behind at a window. I
had been barred out of a place among the first three
columns. I was under a cloud of some kind.”</p>

<p>No, that would not be his answer. Various lies occurred.</p>

<p>This little mental activity completed itself without
any volition. It was finished now, like the picture outside&mdash;the
materials scattering. The idea of the truth
merely appeared through a mental habit of looking at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>two sides&mdash;a literary habit. It had brought no direct
relation to John Morning. But the lies had brought
their direct relation.</p>

<p>He could not remain at his place by the window, now
that the fifty came in for drink and play. He was afraid
to demand what evil concerning him was in the minds of
men; afraid something would be uncovered that was
true. He felt the uncleanness of drink upon him, and a
moral softening from years of newspaper work, a training
begun in glibness, which does not recognize the
rights of men, but obeys a City Desk. He could not
organize a contending force; and yet loathed the thought
of return to the Japanese Inn. He was not ready to face
himself alone.</p>

<p>It had never come to him so stirringly as now&mdash;the
sense of <i>something</i> within, utterly weary of imprisonment
and forced companionship with the visible John
Morning. His misery was a silent unswerving shame.
A feverish impulse almost controlled him to take something
either to lift him away, or permit him to sink in
abandonment from the area of pain.</p>

<p>He stood near the desk in the lobby. Duke Fallows
was coming. The Californian’s legs, in their worn corduroys,
were far too lean for the big bony knees&mdash;a tall
man of forty, with tired and sunken eyes and sunken
mouth. Fallows had a reputation. Its strongly drawing
side-issue was his general and encompassing, though fastidious,
love of women. Someone had whispered that
even if a man has the heart of a volcano, its outpouring
must be spread rather thin in places to cover all women.
He was out for the <i>Western States</i>, not only to show
war, but to show it up. Certainly he loved the under-dog,
which is an epigram for stating that he was an anarchist.</p>

<p>No anarchist could be gentler to meet, nor more terrible
to read. Fallows owned a formidable interest in the
<i>Western States</i>; otherwise he would have had to print
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>himself. The rest of that San Francisco property was
just an excellent newspaper. Its effort was to balance
Duke Fallows; sometimes it seemed trying to extinguish
him in order to save itself. It brought sanity and common-sense
and the group-souled observation of affairs,
to say nothing of news and advertising&mdash;all to cool the
occasional column of this sick man. To a few, however,
on the Pacific Coast, since his new assignment was announced&mdash;the
Russo-Japanese war and Duke Fallows
meant the same thing. The majority said: “Watch the
<i>Western States</i> boom in circulation. They are sending
Fallows to Asia.”</p>

<p>The two stood together, Fallows looking down.
Morning was broad in brow and shoulder; slender otherwise
and of medium height.</p>

<p>“I’m Fallows.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>The tall man’s eyes turned upward so that only the
whites were visible. He fingered his brow as if to pluck
something forth through the bone.</p>

<p>“Come on upstairs.”</p>

<p>Morning followed the large, slow knees. It was less
that the knees wobbled&mdash;rather the frailty of the hangings
and pinnings. They did the three high flights and
began again, finally drawing up in a broad roof-room
that smelled of new harness and overlooking an especially
hard-packed part of Tokyo, toward the Ginza.
Fallows lit the fire that was ready in the grate and
sprawled wearily.</p>

<p>“Where did you study religion, Morning?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t.”</p>

<p>“That’s one way to get it.”</p>

<p>The sound of his own laugh came to Morning’s ears
and hurt him. Fallows’ eyes were shut. There was no
trace of a smile around the wan mouth.</p>

<p>“You’ll likely be more religious before you’re done.
I mean many things by being religious&mdash;a man’s inability
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>to lie to himself for one; a passion for the man who’s
down&mdash;that’s another.... I’ve read your stuff.
It’s full of religion&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Now it seemed to Morning as if he had just entered
a fascinating wilderness; apart from this, he saw something
about the worn, distressed mouth of Fallows that
made him think of himself last night. There was one
more effect from this first brush. Something happened
in Morning’s mind with that sentence about the inability
to lie to one’s self. It was like a shot in the midst of a
flock of quails. A pair of birds was down, but the rest
of the flock was off and away, like the fragments of an
explosive.</p>

<p>“I read some of your stuff about the Filipino woman&mdash;‘woman
of the river-banks,’ you called her. Another
time you looked into a nipa-shack where an old man was
dying of <i>beri-beri</i>, and an old woman sat at bay at the
door&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>These brought back the pictures to Morning, and the
dimension behind the actual light and shade and matter.
The healing, too, was that someone had seen his work,
and seen from it all that he saw,&mdash;the artist’s true aliment,
which praise of the many cannot furnish. It gave
him heart like an answer to prayer, because he had been
very needful.</p>

<p>“You must have come up hard. Did you, boy?”
Fallows asked after a moment.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you would say so.”</p>

<p>“Farm first?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And a father who misunderstood?”</p>

<p>“A good deal of the misunderstanding was my own
bull-headedness, I see now&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And the mother, John Morning?”</p>

<p>“I was too little&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Ah&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Morning found himself saying eagerly a little later:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>
<p>“And then the city streets&mdash;selling newspapers,
errands, sick all the time, though I didn’t know it. Then
I got to the horses.... I found something in the
stables good for me. I liked horses so well that it hurt.
I learned to sleep nights and eat regularly&mdash;but read so
much rot. Still, it was all right to be a stable-boy. A
big race-horse man took me on to ship with stock. I’ve
been all over America by freight with the racers&mdash;from
track to track. I used to let the tramps ride, but they
were dangerous&mdash;especially the young ones. I had to
stay awake. An old tramp could come in anytime&mdash;and
go to sleep&mdash;but younger ones are bad. They beat you
up for a few dimes. I was bad, too, bad as hell....
And then I rode&mdash;there was money, but it went. I got
sick keeping light. The pounds over a hundred beat me
out of the game&mdash;except the jumps. I’ve ridden the
jumpers in England, too&mdash;been all broken up. In a fall
you can’t always get clear.... All this was before
I was eighteen&mdash;it was my kind of education.”</p>

<p>“I like it,” said Fallows.</p>

<p>“One night in New York I heard a newspaper man
talk.... It was in a back-room bar on Sixth avenue.
I see now he was a bit broken down. He looked
to me then all that was splendid and sophisticated. I
wanted to be like him&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Fallows bent forward, his face tender as a father’s.
“You poor little chap,” he said, as if he did not see Morning
now, but the listening boy in the back-room bar.</p>

<p>“You see, I never really got the idea of having money&mdash;it
went so quickly. The idea of a big bundle didn’t
get a chance to sink in. I’ve had several hundred dollars
at once from riding&mdash;but the next day’s races, or the
next, got it. What I’m trying to say is&mdash;winnings didn’t
seem to belong to me. Poverty was a habit. I always
think yet in nickels and dimes. I seem to belong&mdash;steerage.
It wasn’t long after I listened to that reporter,
that I got a newspaper job, chasing pictures. A year
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>after that the wars began. I went out first on my own
hook; in fact, I think you’d call it that now. I seem to
get into a sort of mania to be off&mdash;when the papers
begin to report trouble. I didn’t know I was poorly fixed
this time, until here in Tokyo I saw how the others go
about it. Dinner-clothes, and all sorts of money invested
in them&mdash;whether the war makes good or not&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I was right,” Fallows said finally. He had listened
as a forest in a drouth listens for rain.</p>

<p>Morning was embarrassed. He had been caught in
the current of the other’s listening. It was not his way
at all to talk so much. He wasn’t tamed altogether; and
then he had been extra hurt by the night and the day.
An element of savagery arose, with the suspicion that
Fallows might be making fun of him.</p>

<p>“What were you right about, Mr. Fallows?”</p>

<p>“You’ve got an especial guardian.”</p>

<p>Morning waited. The fuel was crackling. The Californian
watched the fire and finally began to talk.</p>

<p>“You’re <i>one of them</i>. I saw it in your stuff. Then
they told me here that you lived in a little Japanese hotel
alone. That’s another reason. Your kind come up alone&mdash;always
alone. To-day I saw you watching that picture
business. You looked tired&mdash;as if you had a long way
yet to swim against the current. You had a fight on&mdash;inside
and out. You’ll keep on fighting inside, long after
the world outside has called a truce. When you’re as
old as I am&mdash;maybe before&mdash;you’ll have peace inside and
out.”</p>

<p>Morning was bewildered; and had somewhat braced
himself in scepticism, as if the other were reading a fortune
out of a cup.</p>

<p>“You’re one of them, and you’ve got a guardian&mdash;greater
than ten of these militia press-agents. You don’t
know it yet, but your stuff shows it; your life shows it.
You try to do what <i>you</i> want&mdash;and you’re forced to do
better. You’ll be kept steerage, as you call it,&mdash;kept
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>down among men&mdash;until you see that it’s the place for
a white man to be, and that all these other things&mdash;dinner-coats
and expense accounts&mdash;are but tricks to cover
a weakness. You’ll be held down among men until you
love them, and would be sick away from service with
them. You won’t be able to rest unless you’re helping.
You’ll choke when you say ‘Brother.’ You’ll answer
their misery and cry from your sleep, ‘I’m coming.’ You
hear them with your soul now, but the brain won’t listen
yet. You’ll go it blind for the under-dog&mdash;and find out
afterwards that you were immortally right.”</p>

<p>Morning’s breast was burning. It was more the fiery
flood of kindness than the words. He had been roughed
so thoroughly that he couldn’t take words; he needed a
sign.</p>

<p>“The time will come when you’ll hear your soul saying,
‘Get down among men, John, and help.’ You’ll
jump. A storm of hell will follow you if you don’t.
They’ll throw you overboard and even the whale won’t
stomach you if you don’t. ‘Get down among men,
John’; that’s your orders to Nineveh.”</p>

<p>The Californian changed the subject abruptly:</p>

<p>“They were good enough to give me a place with the
first column, but I can’t see it quite. There’s going to
be too much supervision. These Japanese are rivet-headed.
I like the other end. New Chwang is still
open. Lowenkampf is in command there. I knew him
years ago in Vienna. Good man for a soldier&mdash;old
Lowenkampf. He’ll take us in. Let’s go over&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I won’t be exactly ‘healed’ for a long stay. My
money is coming here&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Let it pile up. I’ll stake you for the Russian
picnic.”</p>

<p>Morning wanted it so intensely that he feared Duke
Fallows might die before they got to Lowenkampf and
New Chwang.... He was terrorized by this
thought: “Fallows has somehow failed to understand
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>about me not getting a column, and not being asked into
the picture. When he finds out, he’ll change his
mind....”</p>

<p>He wanted to speak, gathered strength with violent
effort, but Fallows just now was restlessly eager to go
below.</p>

<p class="ph2">6</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">S</span>econd</span> class, that night, on the Pacific liner <i>Manchuria</i>,
forward among the rough wooden bunks,
eating from tin-plates.... It had been Morning’s
suggestion. Fallows had accepted it laughingly, but as
a good omen.</p>

<p>“Two can travel cheaply as one,” he said. “I’m quite
as comfortable as usual.”</p>

<p>Morning realized that his friend was not comfortable
at best. He was too well himself, too ambitious, quite
to realize the other’s illness. Morning found a quality
of understanding that he had expected vaguely to find
sometime from some girl, but he could not return the
gift in kind, nor right sympathy for the big man’s weakness.
Fallow’s didn’t appear to expect it.</p>

<p>They left the <i>Manchuria</i> at Nagasaki, after the Inland
Sea passage, found a small ship for Tientsin direct;
also a leftover winter storm on the Yellow Sea. Morning,
at work, typewriter on his knees, looked up one
night as they neared the mouth of the Pei-ho. An oil-lamp
swung above them smokily; the tired ship still
creaked and wallowed in the gale. Fallows has been
regarding him thoughtfully from time to time.</p>

<p>“You keep bolstering me up, Duke, and I don’t seem
to help you any,” Morning said. “Night and day, I
worry you with the drum of this machine&mdash;when you’re
too sick to work; and here you are traveling like a tramp
for me. I’m used to it, but it makes you worse. You
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>staked me and made possible a bit of real work this campaign&mdash;why
won’t you let me do some stuff for you?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you worry about what I’ve done&mdash;that’s particularly
my affair. Call it a gamble. Perhaps I chose
you as a man chooses his place to build a house....”</p>

<p>Morning wondered at times if the other was not half
dead with longing for a woman.... In the fifteen
years which separated the two men in age lay all the
difference between a soldier and an artist. Morning had
to grant finally that the Californian had no abiding interest
in the war they were out to cover; and this was
so foreign that the rift could not be bridged entirely.</p>

<p>“War&mdash;why, I love the thought!” Fallows exclaimed.
“The fight’s the thing&mdash;but this isn’t it. This is just a
big butchery of the blind. The Japanese aren’t sweet
in this passion. We won’t see the real Russia out here
in Asia. Real Russia is against all this looting and lusting.
Real Russia is at home singing, writing, giving
itself to be hanged. Real Russia is glad to die for a
dream. This soldier Russia isn’t ready to die. Just a
stir in the old torpor of decadence&mdash;this Russia we’re
going to. You’ll see it&mdash;its stench rising.... I
want the other war. I want to live to fight in the other
war, when the under-dog of this world&mdash;the under-dog
of Russia and England and America, runs no more,
cowers no more&mdash;but stops, turns to fight to the death.
I want the barricades, the children fired with the spirit,
women coming down to the ruck, the girls from the factories,
harlots from the slums. The women won’t stay
at home in the war I mean&mdash;and you and I, John, must
be there,&mdash;to die every morning&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Yet Fallows didn’t write this. He lay on his back
dreaming about it. Always the women came into his
thoughts. Morning held hard to the game at hand....
Lying on his back&mdash;thus the Californian became
identified in his mind. And strange berths they found,
none stranger than the one at last in the unspeakable
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>Chinese hotel at New Chwang. Morning remembered
the date&mdash;4/4/’04&mdash;for he put it down in the black notebook,
after smashing a centipede on the wall with it.
They were awakened the next morning by the passing of
a brigade of Russian infantry in full song. Each looking
for “good-morning” in the eyes of the other, found
that and tears.</p>

<p>The Chinese house stirred galvanically at mid-day&mdash;from
the farthest chicken-coop to the guest-chamber of
the most revered. Lowenkampf, commanding the port,
in sky-blue uniform, entered with his orderly and embraced
a certain sick man lying on a rough bench, between
his own blankets. It was just so and not otherwise,
nor were the “European” strangers of distinguished
appearance. They had come in the night, crossing
the river in a junk, instead of waiting for the Liao-launch.
They had not sought the Manchurian hotel,
where Europeans of quality usually go, but had asked
for native quartering. So rarely had this happened, that
the tradition was forgotten in New Chwang about angels
appearing unheralded.</p>

<p>It was a great thing to John Morning, this coming of
General Lowenkampf. He had not dared to trust altogether
in the high friend of Duke Fallows&mdash;nor even in
finding such a friend in New Chwang. The actual fact
meant that they would not be sent out of the zone of
war, when the Russians evacuated from New Chwang,
if Lowenkampf could help it; and who could help it if
not the commander of the garrison? It meant, too, that
everything Duke Fallows had said in his quiet and unadorned
way when speaking of purely mundane affairs
had turned out true.</p>

<p>Fallows sat up in his bunk to receive the embrace he
knew was coming. The General was a small man. He
must have been fifty. He appeared a tired father,&mdash;the
father who puts his hands to his ears and looks terrified
when his children approach, but who loves them with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>secret fury and prays for them in their beds at night.
He had suffered; he had a readiness to tears; he needed
much brandy at this particular interval, as if his day
had not begun well. He spoke of the battle of the Yalu
and his tears were positive. It was a mistake, a hideous
mistake. He said this in English, and with the frightened
intensity of a woman whose lover has died misunderstanding
her.... No, they were not to stay at
New Chwang.... He would make them comfortable....
Yes, he had married a woman six years
ago.... It murders the soldier in a man to marry
a woman and find her like other women. You may
think on the mystery of childbirth a whole life&mdash;but when
your own woman, in your own house, brings you a child,
it is all different. A thing to be awed at.... It
draws the soldier-pith out of one’s spine, as you draw
the nerve out of a tooth.... You are never the
same afterward.</p>

<p>Fallows sank back smiling raptly.</p>

<p>“You’re the same old nervous prince of realizers&mdash;Lowenkampf&mdash;always
realizing your own affairs with
unprecedented realism. God knows, I’m glad to see you....
John Morning, here is a man who can tell you
a thing you have heard before, in a way that you’ll never
forget. It’s because he only talks about what he has
realized for himself. His name is blown in the fabric of
all he says.... Lowenkampf, here’s a <i>boy</i>. I’ve
been looking for him, years&mdash;ever since I found my own
failure inevitable. John Morning&mdash;Lowenkampf, the
General. If you both live to get back to your babies&mdash;Morning’s
are still in the sky, their dawn is not yet&mdash;you
will remember this day&mdash;for it is a significant Trinity....
General, how many babies have you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, my God&mdash;one!”</p>

<p>Fallows seemed unspeakably pleased with that excited
remark. Lowenkampf glanced at the shut eyes of
his old friend, and then out of the window to the sordid
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>Chinese street, where the Russian soldiers moved to and
fro in the unwieldy disquiet of a stage mob in its first
formation.</p>

<p>“But they’re all my babies&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>John Morning had a vision of a battle with that sentence.
All the rest of the day he thrilled with it. Work
was so pure in his heart from the vision, that he left his
machine that night (Duke Fallows seemed asleep) and
touched the brow of his friend....</p>

<p class="ph2">7</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">A</span>ugust</span>&mdash;Liaoyang, the enemy closing in....
There were times when John Morning doubted if
he had ever been away from the sick man, Duke Fallows,
and the crowds of Russian soldiery. Individually
the days were long. Often in mid-afternoon, he stopped
to think if some voice or picture of to-day’s dawning
did not belong to yesterday or last week. Yet routine
settled upon all that was past, and the days accumulated
into a quantity of weeks that grew like the continual
miracle of a hard man’s savings.</p>

<p>Always he missed something. He was hard in health,
but felt white nowhere, in nor out, so much had he been
played upon by sun and wind and dust. The Russian
officers were continually asking him to try new horses&mdash;the
roughest of the untamed purchases brought in by the
Chinese. It had become quite the custom among the
officers to advise with Morning on matters of horse-flesh.
Fallows had started it by telling Lowenkampf
that Morning formerly rode the jumpers in England,
but the younger man had since earned his reputation in
the Russian post.</p>

<p>A sorrel mare had appeared in the city. Rat-tailed
and Roman-nosed she was, and covered with wounds.
They had tried to ride her in from the Hun. Her skin
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>was like satin and she had not been saddled decently.
Just a wild, head-strong young mare in the beginning,
but bad handling had made her a mankiller. Lieutenant
Luban, soft with vodka and cigarettes, had dickered for
the mare, and drunkenly insisted upon mounting at once.
Morning caught the bridle after the first fight, and Luban
slid off in his arms in a state of collapse. Clearly an
adult devil lived in the sorrel. She was red-eyed in her
rage, past pain, and walked like a man. She would have
gone over backwards with Luban, and yet she was lovely
to Morning’s eye, perfect as a yellow rose. He knew
her sort&mdash;the kind that runs to courage and not to hair;
the kind of individual that rarely breeds.</p>

<p>He led her apart, talked to her; knew that she only
cared to kill him and be free. She was outrage; hate
was the breath of her nostrils; but she made Morning
forget his work.... Thirty officers were gathered
in the compound. Morning had saddled her afresh; her
back was easier&mdash;yet she was up, striking, pawing. He
knew she meant to go back. Stirrup-free, he held her
around the neck as she stood poised. His weight was
against her toppling, but sheer deviltry hurled back her
head, breaking the balance. They saw him push the hot
yellow neck from him as she fell. He landed on his
feet, facing her from the side, leaped clear&mdash;and then
darted forward, catching the bridle-rein before she
straightened her first front leg. Morning was in the
saddle before she was up. Then the whole thing was
done over again as perfectly as one with his hand in
repeats a remarkable billiard-shot.</p>

<p>“It’s only a question of time&mdash;she’ll kill you,” said
Fallows.</p>

<p>“How she hates the Chinese, but she’s the gamest
thing in Asia,” Morning answered. “I’d like to be away
alone with her.”</p>

<p>“You’d need a new continent for a romance like
that,” Fallows said, and that night, in their room of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>Lowenkampf’s headquarters, he resumed the subject, his
eyes lost in the dun ceiling.</p>

<p>“There’s only one name for that sorrel mare, if I’m
consulted.”</p>

<p>“Name her,” Morning said.</p>

<p>“The one I’m thinking of&mdash;her name is Eve.”</p>

<p>Fallows shivered, and turned the subject, but Morning
knew he would come back.... They heard the
sentries on the stone flags below. It was monotonous
as the sound of the river. An east wind had blown all
afternoon. Dust was gritty in the blankets, sore in the
rifts of lip and nostril caused by the long baking wind.
Their eyes felt old in the dry heat. Daily the trains
had brought more Russians; daily more Chinese refugees
slipped out behind. Liaoyang was a mass of soldiery&mdash;heavy
and weary with soldiers&mdash;dull with its single
thought of defense. For fifty or more miles, the southern
arc of the circle about the old walled city was a
system of defense&mdash;chains of Russian redoubts, complicated
entanglements, hill emplacements and rifle-pits.
Beyond this the Japanese gathered openly and prepared.
It seemed as if the earth itself would scream from the
break in the tension when firing began....</p>

<p>“John&mdash;a man must be alone&mdash;&mdash;” Fallows said
abruptly.</p>

<p>“That’s one of the first things you told me&mdash;and that
a man mustn’t lie to himself.”</p>

<p>“It must be thinking about your romance with that
sorrel fiend&mdash;that brings her so close to-night, I mean
the real Eve. I had to put the ocean between us&mdash;and
yet she comes. Listen, John, when you are dull and
tired after a hard day, you take a drink or two of
brandy. You, especially you, are new and lifted again.
That’s what happens to me when a woman comes into
the room....”</p>

<p>Twice before Morning had been on the verge of this,
and something spoiled it. He listened now, for Fallows
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>opened his heart. His eyes held unblinkingly the dim
shadows of the ceiling. The step of the sentries sank
into the big militant silence&mdash;and this was revelation:</p>

<p>“God, how generous women are with their treasures!
They are devils because of their great-heartedness. So
swift, so eager, so delicate in their giving. They look
up at you, and you are lost. My life has been gathering
a bouquet&mdash;and some flowers fade in your hand....
I hated it, but they looked up so wistfully&mdash;and it seemed
as if I were rending in a vacuum.... Always the
moment of illusion&mdash;that <i>this</i> one is the last, that here
is completion, that peace will come with <i>this</i> fragrance;
always their giving is different and very beautiful&mdash;and
always the man is deeper in hell for their bestowal....
A day or a month&mdash;man’s incandescence is gone.
Brown eyes, blue eyes&mdash;face pale or ruddy&mdash;lips passionate
or pure&mdash;their giving momentary or immortal&mdash;and
yet, I could not stay. Always they were hurt&mdash;less
among men, less among their sisters, and no strangers
to suffering&mdash;and always hell accumulated upon my
head.... Then she came. There’s a match in the
world for every man. Her name is Eve. She is the
answer of her sisterhood to such as I.</p>

<p>“She was made so. She will not have me near. And
yet with all her passion and mystery she is calling to
me. The rolling Pacific isn’t broad enough. She has
bound me by all that I have given to others, by all that
I have denied others. She was made to match me, and
came to her task full-powered, as the sorrel mare came
to corral to-day for you.... Oh, yes, I honor her.”</p>

<p>There was silence which John Morning could not
break. Fallows began to talk of death&mdash;in terms which
the other remembered.</p>

<p>“... For the death of the body makes no difference.
In the body here we build our heaven or hell.
If we have loved possessions of the earth&mdash;we are
weighted with them afterward,&mdash;imprisoned among
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>them. If we love flesh here, we are held like shadows
to fleshly men and women, enmeshed in our own prevailing
desire. If our life has been one of giving to others,
of high and holy things&mdash;we are at the moment of the
body’s death, like powerful and splendid birds suddenly
hearing the mystic call of the South. Death, it is the
great cleansing flight into the South....”</p>

<p>This from the sick man, was new as the first rustle
of Spring to John Morning; yet within, he seemed long
to have been expectant. There was thrill in the spectacle
of the other who had learned by losing....</p>

<p>Morning’s mind was like the beleaguered city&mdash;desperate
with waiting and potential disorder, outwardly
arrogant, afraid in secret.... Duke Fallows was
thinking of a woman, as he visioned his lost paradise.
The younger man left the lamp-light to go to him, and
heard as he leaned over the cot:</p>

<p>“... Like a lost traveler to the single point of
light, John, I shall go to her. Eve&mdash;the one red light&mdash;I
will glow red in the desire of her. She is my creation.
Out of the desire of my strength she was created. As
they have mastered me in the flesh, this creation of mine
shall master me afterward&mdash;with red perpetual mastery.”</p>

<p>Lowenkampf came in. They saw by his eyes that
he was more than ever drawn, in the tension and heart-hunger.
He always brought his intimacies to the Americans.
A letter had reached him from Europe in the
morning, but the army had given him no time to think
until now. It was not the letter, but something in it,
that reminded him of a story. So he brought his brandy
and the memory:</p>

<p>“... It was two or three evenings before I left
Petersburg to come here. I had followed him about&mdash;my
little son who is five years. I had followed him about
the house all day. Every little while at some door, or
through some curtain&mdash;I would see the mother smiling
at us. It was new to me&mdash;for I had been seldom home
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>in the day-time&mdash;this playing with one’s little son through
the long day. But God, I knew I was no longer a soldier.
I think the little mother knew. She is braver than
I. She was the soldier&mdash;for not a tear did I see all that
day.... And that night I lay down with my little
son to talk until he fell asleep. It was dark in the room,
but light was in the hall-way and the door open....
You see, he is just five&mdash;and very pure and fresh.”</p>

<p>Fallows sat up. He was startling in the shadow.</p>

<p>“... For a long time my little man stirred and
talked&mdash;of riding horses, when his legs were a little
longer, and of many things to do. He would be a soldier,
of course. God pity the little thought. We would
ride together soon&mdash;not in front of my saddle, but on a
pony of his own&mdash;one that would keep up. I was to
take him out to swim ... and we would walk in
the country to see the trees and animals.... My
heart ached for love of him&mdash;and I, the soldier, wished
there were no Asia in this world, no Asia, nor any war
or torment.... He had seen a gray pony which he
liked, because it had put its head down, as if to listen.
It didn’t wear any straps nor saddle, but came close, as
one knowing a friend, and put its head down&mdash;thus the
child was speaking to me.</p>

<p>“And I heard her step in the hall&mdash;the light, quick
step. Her figure came into the light of the door-way.
She looked intently through the shadows where we lay,
her eyelids lifted, and a smile on her lips. Our little son
saw her and this is what he said so drowsily:</p>

<p>“‘We are talking about what we will do&mdash;when we
get to be men.’”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Fallows broke this silence:</p>

<p>“‘When we get to be men.’ Thank you, General.
That was good for me.... Our friend John
needed that little white cloud, too. I’ve just been leading
him among the wilted primroses.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>
<p>Morning did not speak.</p>

<p>Lowenkampf said the fighting would begin around the
outer position to-morrow.... But that had been
said before.</p>

<p class="ph2">8</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">O</span>n</span> the night of August 31st, for all the planning, the
progress of the battle was not to the Russian liking.
All that day the movements of the Russians had
mystified John Morning. The broad bend of the river to
the east of the city had been crowded with troops&mdash;seemingly
an aimless change of pastures. He felt that
after all his study of the terrain and its possibilities, the
big thing was getting away from him. When he mentioned
this ugly fear to Fallows, the answer was:</p>

<p>“And that’s just what the old man feels.”</p>

<p>Fallows referred to Kuropatkin.</p>

<p>The monster spectacle had blinded Morning. He had
to hold hard at times to keep his rage from finding words
in answer to Duke Fallows’ scorn for the big waiting-panorama
which had enthralled him utterly&mdash;the fleeing
refugees, singing infantry, the big gun postures, the
fluent cavalry back along the railroad, the armored hills,
the whole marvelous atmosphere.... None of this
appeared to matter to Fallows. He had written little or
nothing. God knew why he had come. He would do
a story, of course.... Morning had written a book&mdash;the
climax of which would be the battle. He had
staked all on the majesty of the story. His career would
be constructed upon it. He would detach himself from
all this and appear suddenly in America&mdash;the one man in
America who knew Liaoyang. He would be Liaoyang;
his mind the whole picture. He knew the wall, the Chinese
names of the streets, the city and its tenderloin,
where the Cantonese women were held in hideous bondage.
He knew the hills and the river&mdash;the rapid treachery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
of the Taitse. He had watched the trains come in
from Europe with food, horses, guns and men; had even
learned much Russian and some Chinese. He had
studied Lowenkampf, Bilderling, Zarubaieff, Mergenthaler;
had looked into the eyes of Kuropatkin himself....</p>

<p>Duke Fallows said:</p>

<p>“All this is but one idea, John&mdash;one dirty little idea
multiplied. Don’t let a couple of hundred thousand soldiers
spoil the fact in your mind. Lowenkampf personally
isn’t capable of fighting for himself on such a rotten
basis. Fighting with a stranger on a neighbor’s property&mdash;that’s
the situation. Russia says to Old Man China,
‘Go, take a little airing among your hills. A certain
enemy of mine is on the way here, and I want to kill
him from your house. It will be a dirty job, but it is
important to me that he be killed just so. I’ll clean up
the door-step afterward, repair all damages, and live in
your house myself.... And the Japanese have
trampled the flowers and vegetable-beds of the poor old
Widow Korea to get here&mdash;&mdash;’”</p>

<p>Thus the Californian took the substance out of the
hundred thousand words Morning had written in the
past few months. Dozens of small articles had been sent
out until a fortnight ago through Lowenkampf, via
Shanghai, but the main fiber of each was kept for this
great story, which he meant to sell in one piece in
America.</p>

<p><i>Kuropatkin</i>&mdash;both Morning and Fallows saw him as
the mighty beam in the world’s eye at this hour. To
Morning he was the risen master of events; to Fallows
merely a figure tossed up from the moil. Morning saw
him as the source of power to the weak, as a silencer of
the disputatious and the envious, as the holding selvage
to the vast Russian garment, worn, stained and ready to
ravel, the one structure of hope in a field of infinite failures.
Fallows saw him as an integral part of all this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>disorder and disruption, one whose vision was marvelous
only in the detection of excuses for himself in the action
of others; whose sorrow was a pose and whose <i>self</i> was
far too imperious for him firmly to grip the throat of a
large and vital obstacle. What Morning called the mystical
somberness of the chief, Fallows called the sullen
silence of dim comprehension. Somewhere between these
notations the Commander stood.... They had seen
him at dusk that day. “He seems to be repressing himself
by violent effort,” the younger man whispered.</p>

<p>“What would you say he were repressing, John&mdash;his
appetite?”</p>

<p>The answer was silence, and late that night, (the
Russian force was now tense and compact as a set
spring), Fallows dropped down upon his cot, saying:</p>

<p>“You think I’m a scoffer, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“You break a man’s point, that’s all&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I know&mdash;but we’re not to be together always....
Listen, don’t think me a scoffer, even now.
These big, bulky things won’t hold you forever. Perhaps,
if I were a bigger man, I’d keep silent. You’ll
write them well, no doubt about that.... But don’t
get into the habit of thinking me a scoffer. There’s such
a lot of finer things to fall for. John, I wasn’t a scoffer
when I first read your stuff&mdash;and saw big forces moving
around you.... A man who knows a little about
women, knows a whole lot about men.... To be
a famous soldier, John, a man can’t have any such forces
moving around him. He must be an empty back-ground.
All his strength is the compound of meat and eggs and
fish; his strength goes to girth and jowl and fist&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You’re a wonderful friend to me, Duke.”</p>

<p>“That’s just what I didn’t want you to say....
There’s no excellence on my part. Like a good book, I
couldn’t riddle you in one reading.”</p>

<p>Morning found himself again, as he wrote on that
last night of preparation; that last night of summer. It
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>was always the way, when the work came well. It
brought him liveableness with himself and kindness for
others. He had his own precious point of view again,
too. He pictured Kuropatkin ... sitting at his desk,
harried by his sovereign, tormented by princes, seeing
as no other could see the weaknesses in the Russian displays
of power, and knowing the Japanese better than
any other; the man who had come up from Plevna fighting,
who had written his fightings, who was first to say,
“We are not ready,” and first to gather up the unpreparedness
for battle.</p>

<p>Morning felt himself the reporter of the Fates for
this great carnage. He wanted to see the fighting, to
miss no phase of it&mdash;to know the mechanics, the results,
the speed, the power, weakness and every rending of this
great force. He did not want the morals of it, the evil
spirit behind, but the brute material action. He wanted
the literary Kuropatkin, not a possible reality. He
wanted the one hundred thousand words driven by the
one-seeing, master-seeing reporter’s instinct. He was
Russian in hope and aspiration&mdash;but absolutely negative
in what was to take place. He wanted the illusion of the
service; he saw the illusion more clearly; so could the
public. The illusion bore out every line of his work so
far. To laugh at the essence of the game destroyed its
meaning, and the huge effect he planned to make in
America.</p>

<p>Morning was sorry now for having lost during the
day the sense of fine relation with Fallows, but everything
he had found admirable&mdash;from toys and sweets to
wars and women&mdash;the sick man had found futile and
betraying; everything that his own mind found good
was waylaid and diminished by the other. Fallows, in
making light of the dramatic suspense of the city, had
struck at the very roots of his ambition. The work of
the night had healed this all, however.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span></p>
<p>The last night of summer&mdash;joyously he ended the big
picture. Three themes ran through entire&mdash;Nodzu’s
artillery, under which the Russians were willingly dislodging
from the shoulders and slopes of Pensu-marong;
the tread of the Russian sentries below, (a real bit of
Russian bass in the Liaoyang symphony), and the glissando
of the rain.</p>

<p>He sat back from his machine at last. There were
two hundred and seventy sheets altogether of thin tough
parchment-copy&mdash;400 words to the page, and the whole
could be folded into an inside pocket. It was ready for
the battle itself.... All the Morning moods were
in the work&mdash;moments of photographic description, of
philosophic calm, instant reversals to glowing idealism&mdash;then
the thrall of the spectacle&mdash;finally, a touch, just a
touch to add age, of Fallows’ scorn. It was newspaper
stuff&mdash;what was wanted. He had brought his whole instrument
up to concert-pitch to-night. The story was
ready for the bloody artist.</p>

<p>His heart softened emotionally toward Fallows lying
on his back over in the shadows.... Lowenkampf
came in for a queer melting moment.... Morning
looked affectionately at his little traveling type-mill. It
had never faltered&mdash;a hasty, cheap, last-minute purchase
in America, but it had seen him through. It was like a
horse one picks up afield, wears out and never takes
home, but thinks of many times in the years afterward.
Good little beast.... And this made him think
with a thrill of Eve, brooding in the dark below....
She was adjusted to a thought in his mind that had to
do with the end of the battle. It was a big-bored,
furious idea. Morning glanced at his watch. Two-fifteen
on the morning of September. He unlaced one
shoe, but the idea intervened again and he moved off in
the stirring dream of it. It was three o’clock when he
bent to the other shoe.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span></p>

<p class="ph2">9</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">A</span>ll</span> the next day, Liaoyang was shelled from the
south and southeast; all day Eve shivered and
sweated in the smoky turmoil. At dusk, Morning, to
whom the mare was far too precious to be worn out in
halter, rode back to Yentai along the railroad. She operated
like a perfect toy over that twelve miles of beaten
turf. The rain ceased for an hour or two, and the dark
warmth of the night seemed to poise her every spring.
The man was electric from her. At the station Morning
learned that Lowenkampf, with thirteen battalions,
already had occupied the lofty coal-fields, ten miles to
the east on a stub of the railroad. He had first supposed
the force of Siberians now crowding the station
to be Lowenkampf’s men; instead it was his reserve.
Eve had lathered richly, so that an hour passed before
she was cool enough for grain or water. He rubbed her
down, meanwhile, talked to her softly and made plans.
Her eye flashed red at the candle, as he shut the door of
the stable. That night on foot he did the ten miles to
the collieries, joining Fallows and the General at midnight....
Morning was struck with the look of
Lowenkampf’s face. He wasn’t taking a drink that
night; his mouth was old and white. A thin bar of pallor
stretched obliquely from chin to cheek-bone. The
chin trembled, too; the eyes were hungerful, yet so kind.
Desperate incongruity somewhere. This man should
have been back in Europe with his neighbors about the
fire&mdash;his comrade tucked in up-stairs, the little mother
pouring tea. And yet, Lowenkampf&mdash;effaced with his
anguish and dreamy-eyed, as if surveying the distance
between his heaven and hell&mdash;was the brain of the sledge
that was to break the Flanker’s back-bone to-morrow.</p>

<p>“The Taitse is only ten miles south,” said Fallows,
as they turned in. “Bilderling is there. Kuroki is supposed
to poke his nose in between, and Lowenkampf is to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>smash it against Bilderling. Mergenthaler’s Cossacks
are here to take the van in the morning, and we’re backed
up by a big body of Siberians, stretching behind to Yentai
station&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I saw ’em,” said Morning. “Lowenkampf looks sick
with strain.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Day appeared, with just the faintest touch of red
showing like a broken bit of glass. Rain-clouds, bursting-heavy,
immediately rolled over it,&mdash;a deluge of grays,
leisurely stirring with whitish and watery spots. Though
his troops were taking the field, Lowenkampf had not
left his quarters in the big freight <i>go-down</i>. Commanders
hurried in and out. Fallows was filling two canteens
with diluted tea, when an old man entered, weeping. It
was Colonel Ritz, bent, red-eyed, nearly seventy, who had
been ordered, on account of age and decrepitude, to remain
with the staff. Brokenly, he begged for his command.</p>

<p>“I have always stayed with the line, General. I shall
be quick as another. Don’t keep an old man, who has
always stuck to the line&mdash;don’t keep one like that back
in time of battle.”</p>

<p>Lowenkampf smiled and embraced him&mdash;sending him
out with his regiment.</p>

<p>Mergenthaler now came in. There was something
icy and hateful about this Roman-faced giant. His countenance
was like a bronze shield&mdash;so small the black eyes,
and so wide and high the cheek-bones. For months his
Cossacks had done sensational work&mdash;small fighting, far
scouting, desperate service. He despised Lowenkampf;
believed he had earned the right to be the hammer to-day;
and, in truth, he had, but Lowenkampf, who ranked
him, had been chosen. Bleak and repulsive with rage,
the Cossack chief made no effort to repress himself.
Lowenkampf was reminded that he had been policing the
streets of Liaoyang for weeks, that his outfit was “fat-heeled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
and duck-livered.”... More was said before
Mergenthaler stamped out, his jaw set like a stone
balcony. It seemed as if he tore from the heart of Lowenkampf
the remnant of its stamina.... For a
moment the three were alone in the head-quarters. Fallows
caught the General by the shoulders and looked
down in his face:</p>

<p>“Little Father&mdash;you’re the finest and most courageous
of them all.... It will be known and proven&mdash;what
I say, old friend&mdash;‘when we get to be men.’”</p>

<p>The masses of Lowenkampf’s infantry, forming on
the heights among the coal-fields, melted at the outer
edges and slid downward. Willingly the men went.
They did not know that this was the day. They had
been fearfully expectant of battle at first&mdash;ever since
Lake Baikal was crossed. Battalion after battalion slid
off the heights, and were lost in the queer lanes running
through the rocks and low timber below. The general
movement was silent. The rain held off; the air was
close and warm. Lowenkampf, unvaryingly attentive
to the two Americans, put them in charge of Lieutenant
Luban, the young staff officer, whom Morning had
caught in his arms from the back of the sorrel. Down
the ledges they went, as the others.</p>

<p>Morning was uneasy, as one who feels he has forgotten
something&mdash;a tugging in his mind to go back.
He was strongly convinced that Lowenkampf was unsubstantial
in a military way. He could not overcome the
personal element of this dread&mdash;as if the General were of
his house, and he knew better than another that he was
ill-prepared for the day’s trial.</p>

<p>Fallows welcomed any disaster. As he had scorned
the army in its waiting, he scorned it now in its strike.
He looked very lean and long. The knees were in corduroy
and unstable, but his nerve could not have been
steadier had he been called to a tea-party by Kuroki.
As one who had long since put these things behind him,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>Fallows appeared; indeed, as one sportively called out by
the younger set, to whom severing the spine of a flanker
was fresh and engrossing business.... Morning
choked with suppressions. Luban talked low and wide.
He was in a funk. Both saw it. Neither would have
objected, except that he monopolized their thoughts with
his broken English, and to no effect.</p>

<p>Now they went into the <i>kao liang</i>&mdash;vast, quiet, enfolding.
It held the heat stale from yesterday. The seasonal
rains had filled the spongy loam at the roots, with
much to spare blackening the lower stems.... For
an hour and a half they sunk into the several paths and
lost themselves, Lowenkampf’s untried battalions. The
armies of the world might have vanished so, only to be
seen by the birds, moving like vermin in a hide....
Men began to think of food and drink. The heights of
Yentai, which they had left in bitter hatred so shortly
ago, was now like hills of rest on the long road home.
More and more the resistance of men shrunk in the evil
magic of this pressure of grain and sky and holding
earth&mdash;a curious, implacable unworldliness it was, that
made the flesh cry out.</p>

<p>“They should have cut this grain,” Luban said for the
third time.</p>

<p>Fallows had said it first. Anyone should have seen
the ruin of this advance, unless the end of the millet were
reached before the beginning of battle. They had to recall
with effort at last, that there was an outer world of
cities and seas and plains&mdash;anything but this hollow country
of silence and fatness.</p>

<p>If you have ever jumped at the sudden drumming of
a pneumatic hammer, as it rivets a bolt against the steel,
you have a suggestion of the nervous shock from that
first far machine-gun of Kuroki’s&mdash;just a suggestion,
because Lowenkampf’s soldiers at the moment were suffocating
in <i>kao liang</i>.... In such a strange and expensive
way, they cut the crops that day.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span></p>
<p>Morning trod on the tail of the battalion ahead. It
had stopped; he had not. The soldier in front whom
he bumped turned slowly around and looked into his
face. The wide, glassy blue eyes then turned to Fallows,
and after resting a curious interval, finally found
Luban.</p>

<p>The face was broad and white as lard. Whatever else
was in it, there was no denying the fear, the hate, the
cunning&mdash;all of a rudimentary kind. Luban was held by
the man’s gaze. The fright in both hearts sparked in
contact. The stupid face of the soldier suddenly reflected
the terror of the officer. And this was the result:
The wide-staring suddenly altered to a squint; the vacant,
helpless staring of a bewildered child turned into the
bright activity of a trapped rodent.</p>

<p>Luban had failed in his great instant. His jaw was
loose-hinged, his mouth leaked saliva.</p>

<p>Now Morning and Fallows saw other faces&mdash;twenty
faces in the grain, faces searching for the nearest officer.
Their eyes roved to Luban; necks craned among the fox-tails.
There was a slow giving of the line, and bumping
contacts from ahead like a string of cars....
Morning recalled the look of Luban, as he had helped
him down from the sorrel. He had helped then; he
hated now. Fallows was better. He plumped the boy
on the shoulder and said laughingly:</p>

<p>“Talk to ’em. Get ’em in hand&mdash;quick, Luban&mdash;or
they’ll be off!”</p>

<p>It was all in ten seconds. The nearest soldiers had
seen Luban fail. Other platoons, doubtless many,
formed in similar tableaux to the same end. A second
machine-gun took up the story. It was far-off, and
slightly to the left of the Russian line of advance. The
incomprehensible energy of the thing weakened the Russian
column, although it drew no blood.</p>

<p>A roar ahead from an unseen battalion-officer&mdash;the
Russian <i>Forward</i>. Luban tried to repeat it, but pitifully.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>A great beast rising from the ooze and settling back
<i>against</i> the voice&mdash;such was the answer.</p>

<p>The Thought formed. It was the thought of the day.
None was too stupid to catch the spirit of it. Certain it
was, and pervading as the grain. Indeed, it was conceived
of <i>kao liang</i>. The drum of the machine-gun, like
a file in a tooth, was but its quickener. It flourished
under the ghostly grays and whites of the sky. In the
forward battalions the Thought already clothed itself in
action:</p>

<p>To run back&mdash;to follow the paths back through the
grain&mdash;to reach the decent heights again. And this
was but a miniature of the thought that mastered the
whole Russian army in Asia&mdash;to go back&mdash;to rise from
the ghastly hollows of Asia and turn homeward
again.</p>

<p>It leaped like a demon upon the unset volition of the
mass. Full-formed, it arose from the lull. It effected
the perfect turning.</p>

<p>Morning saw it, and wanted the source. He had
planned too long to be denied now. The rout was big
to handle, but he wanted <i>the front</i>&mdash;a glimpse of the
actual inimical line. It was not enough for him to watch
the fright and havoc streaming back. Calling a cheery
<i>adieu</i> to Fallows, he bowed against the current&mdash;alone
obeying the Russian <i>Forward</i>.</p>

<p class="ph2">10</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">A</span>t</span> the edge of the trampled lane, often shunted off
into the standing crop, Morning made his way,
running when he could.... The pictures were infinite;
a lifetime of pictures; hundreds of faces and each
a picture. Men passed him, heads bowed, arms about
their faces, like figures in the old Dore paintings, running
from the wrath of the Lord. Here and there was
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>pale defiance. Nine sheepish soldiers carried a single
wounded man, the much-handled fallen one looking silly
as the rest.</p>

<p>The utter ghostliness of it all was in Morning’s mind....
Gasping for breath, after many minutes of running,
he sank down to rest. Soldiers sought to pick him
up and carry him back. There were others who could
not live with themselves after the first panic. They fell
out of the retreat to join him. Others stopped to fire&mdash;a
random emptying of magazines in the millet. Certain
groups huddled when they saw him&mdash;mistaking a civilian
for an officer&mdash;and covered their faces. Officers begged,
prayed for the men to hold, but the torrent increased,
individuals diving into the thick of the grain and leaking
around behind. White showed beneath the beards, and
white lips moved in prayer. The locked bayonets of the
Russians had never seemed so dreadful as when low-held
in the grain.... One beardless boy strode back
jauntily, his lips puckered in a whistle.</p>

<p>The marvelous complexity of common men&mdash;this was
the sum of all pictures, and the great realization of John
Morning. His soul saw much that his eyes failed. The
day was a marvelous cabinet of gifts&mdash;secret chambers
to be opened in after years.</p>

<p>Now he was running low, having entered the zone of
fire. He heard the steel in the grain; stems were
snapped by invisible fingers; fox-tails lopped. He saw the
slow leaning of stems half-cut.... Among the
fallen, on a rising slope, men were crawling back; and
here and there, bodies had been cast off, the cloth-covered
husks of poor driven peasants. They had gone back to
the soil, these bodies, never really belonging to the soldiery.
It was only when they writhed that John Morning
forgot himself and his work. The art of the dead
was consummate.</p>

<p>The grain thinned. He had come to the end of Lowenkampf’s
infantry. It had taken an hour and a half
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>for the command to enter in order; less than a half-hour
to dissipate. The rout had been like a cloud-burst.</p>

<p>And this was the battle. (Morning had to hold fast
to the thought.) Long had he waited for this hour;
months he had constructed the army in his story for this
hour of demolition. It was enough to know that Lowenkampf
had failed. Liaoyang, the battle, was lost....
Old Ritz went by weeping&mdash;he had been too old,
they said; they had not wanted him to take his regiment
to field. Yet he was perhaps the last to leave the field.
Only his dead remained, and Colonel Ritz was not weeping
for them....</p>

<p>Now Morning saw it was <i>not</i> all over. Before gaining
the ridge swept by Kuroki’s fire, he knew that Mergenthaler
was still fighting. It came to him with the
earthy rumble of cavalry. To the left, in a crevasse
under the crest of the ridge, he saw a knot of horses
with empty saddles, and a group of men. Closer to them
he crawled, along the sheltered side of the ridge, until in
the midst of Russian officers, he saw that splendid bruising
brute, who had stamped out of headquarters that
morning, draining the heart of Lowenkampf as he went.
Mergenthaler of the Cossacks&mdash;designed merely to be
the eyes and fingers of the fighting force; yet unsupported,
unbodied as it were, he still held the ridge.</p>

<p>Kuroki, as yet innocent of the rout, would not otherwise
have been checked. His ponderous infantry was
not the sort to be stopped by these light harriers of the
Russian army. The Flanker was watching for the Hammer,
and the Hammer already had been shattered....
Mergenthaler, cursing, handled his cavalry
squadrons to their death, lightly and perfectly as coins
in his palm. Every moment that he stayed the Japanese,
he knew well that he was holding up to the quick scorn
of the world the foot-soldiers of Lowenkampf, whom he
hated. His head was lifted above the rocks to watch the
field. His couriers came and went, slipping up and down
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>through the thicker timber, still farther to the left....
Morning crawled up nearby until he saw the
field&mdash;and now action, more abandoned than he had ever
dared to dream:</p>

<p>An uncultivated valley strewn with rocks and low
timber. Three columns of Japanese infantry pouring
down from the opposite parallel ridge, all smoky with
the hideous force of the reserve&mdash;machine-guns, and a
mile of rifles stretching around to the right. (It was this
wing’s firing that had started the havoc in the grain.)</p>

<p>Three columns of infantry pouring down into the
ancient valley, under the gray stirring sky&mdash;brown columns,
very even and unhasting&mdash;and below, the Cossacks.</p>

<p>Morning lived in the past ages. He lay between two
rocks watching, having no active sense&mdash;but pure receptivity.
Time was thrust back.... Three brown
dragons crawling down the slopes in the gray day&mdash;knights
upon horses formed to slay the dragons.</p>

<p>Out of the sheltering rocks and timber they rode&mdash;and
chose the central dragon quite in the classic way.
It turned to meet the knights upon horses&mdash;head lifted,
neck swollen like the nuchal ribs of the cobra. In the
act of striking it was ridden down, but the knights were
falling upon the smashed head. The mated dragons had
attacked from either side....</p>

<p>It was a fragment, a moving upon the ground,&mdash;that
company of knights upon horses,&mdash;and the Voice of it,
all but deadened by the rifles, came up spent and pitiful.</p>

<p>Mergenthaler’s thin, high voice was not hushed. He
knew how to detach another outfit from the rocks and
timber-thickets, already found by the Japanese on the
ridge, already deluged with fire. Out from the betraying
shelter, the second charge, a new child of disaster,
ran forth to strike Kuroki’s left.... Parts of the
film were elided. The cavalrymen fell away by a terrible
magic. Again the point thickened and drew back, met
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>the charge; again the welter and the thrilling back-sweep
of the Russian fragment.</p>

<p>Morning missed something. His soul was listening
for something.... It was comment from Duke
Fallows, so long marking time to events.... He
laughed. He was glad to be free, yet his whole inner
life drew back in loathing from Mergenthaler&mdash;as if to
rush to his old companion.... And Mergenthaler
turned&mdash;the brown high-boned cheeks hung with a smile
of derision. He was climbing far and high on Lowenkampf’s
shame.... He gained the saddle&mdash;this
hard, huge Egoist, the staff clinging to him, and over the
ridge they went to set more traps.</p>

<p>The wide, rocking shoulders of the General sank into
the timber&mdash;as he trotted with his aides down the death-ridden
valley. It may have been the sight of this little
party that started a particular machine-gun on the Japanese
right.... The sizable bay the chief rode
looked like a polo-pony under the mighty frame. Morning
did not see him fall: only the plunging bay with an
empty saddle; and then when the timber opened a little,
the staff carrying the leader up the trail.</p>

<p>It was the mystery which delayed the Japanese, not
Mergenthaler. When at last Kuroki’s left wing continued
to report no aggressive movement from Bilderling
river-ward; and when continued combing in the north
raised nothing but bleak hills and grain-valleys hushed
between showers, he flooded further columns down the
ridge, and slew what he could of the Russian horsemen
who tried with absurd heroism to block his way. At two
in the afternoon the Flanker fixed his base among the
very rocks where Morning had lain&mdash;and the next position
for him to take was the coal-hills of Yentai. Only
the ghosts of the cavalry stood between&mdash;and <i>kao liang</i>.</p>

<p>Morning turned back a last time to the fields of millet
in the early dusk. He had been waiting for Mergenthaler
to die. The General lay in the very <i>go-down</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>where he had outraged Lowenkampf that morning; and
now the Japanese were driving the Russians from the
position.... Mergenthaler would not die. They
carried him to a coal-car, and soldiers pushed it on to
Yentai, the station.</p>

<p>The Japanese were closing in. They were already in
the northern heights contending with Stakelberg; they
were stretched out bluffing Bilderling to the southward.
They were locked with Zarubaieff at the southern front
of Liaoyang. They were in the grain.... Cold
and soulless Morning felt, as one who has failed in a
great temptation; as one who has lived to lose, and has
not been spared the picture of his own eternal failure.</p>

<p>He looked back a last time at the grain in the closing
night. The Japanese were there, brown men, native to
the grain. The great shadowed field had whipped Lowenkampf
and lost the battle. It lay in the dusk like a
woman, trampled, violated, feebly waving. Rain-clouds
came with darkness to cover the nakedness and bleeding.</p>

<p class="ph2">11</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">D</span>uke</span> Fallows saw but one face....
John Morning studied a thousand, mastered the
heroism of the Cossacks, filled his brain with blood-pictures
and the incorrigible mystery of common men.
Duke Fallows saw but one face. In the beauty and
purity of its inspiration, he read a vile secret out of the
past. To the very apocalypse of this secret, he read and
understood. The shame of it blackened the heavens for
his eyes, but out of its night and torment came a Voice
uttering the hope of the human spirit for coming days.</p>

<p>Morning had left. Luban had put on bluster and
roaring. Their place in the grain was now broad from
trampling; the flight was on in full. It meant something
to Fallows. It was not that he wanted the Japanese to
win the battle; the doings of the Japanese were of little
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>concern to him. He felt curiously that the Japanese
were spiritually estranged from the white man. Russia
was different; he was close to the heart of the real Russia
whose battle was at home. Russia’s purpose in Asia
was black; he was full of scorn for the purpose, but full
of love for the troops. Strange gladness was upon him&mdash;as
the men broke away. Reality at home would come
from this disaster. He constructed the world’s battle
from it, and sang his song.</p>

<p>One soldier running haltingly for his life looked up
to the face of Luban of the roaring voice&mdash;and laughed.
Luban turned, and perceived that Fallows had not missed
the laugh of the soldier. This incident, now closed, was
in a way responsible for the next.</p>

<p>... Out of the grain came striding a tall soldier
of the ranks. His beard was black, his eyes very blue.
In his eyes was a certain fire that kindled the nature of
Duke Fallows as it had never been kindled before, not
even by the most feminine yielding. The man’s broad
shoulders were thrust back; his face clean of cowardice,
clean as the grain and as open to the sky. His head
was erect and bare; he carried no gun, scorned the pretense
of looking for wounded. Had he carried a dinner-pail,
the picture would have been as complete&mdash;a good
man going home from a full-testing day.</p>

<p>In that moment Fallows saw more than from the
whole line before.... Here was a conscript. He
had been taken from his house, forced across Europe and
Asia to this hour. The reverse of his persecutors had
set him free. This freedom was the fire in his eyes....
They had torn him from his house; they had
driven and brutalized him for months. And now they
had come to dreadful disaster. It was such a disaster as
a plain man might have prayed for. He <i>had</i> prayed
for it in the beginning, but in the long, slow gatherings
for battle, in the terrible displays of power, he had lost
his faith to pray. Yet the plain man’s God had answered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
that early prayer. This was the brightness of the
burning in the blue eyes.</p>

<p>His persecutors had been shamed and undone. He
had seen his companions dissipate, his sergeants run;
seen his captains fail to hold. The great force that had
tortured him, that had seemed <i>the world</i> in strength, was
now broken before his eyes. Its mighty muscles were
writhing, their strength running down. The love of God
was splendid in the ranker’s heart; the breath of home
had come. The turning in the grain&mdash;was a turning
homeward.</p>

<p>All this Fallows saw. It was illumination to him&mdash;the
hour of his great reception.</p>

<p>Luban, just insulted by the other infantryman, now
faced the big, blithe presence, emerging unhurried from
the grain. Luban raised his voice:</p>

<p>“And what are <i>you</i> sneaking back for?”</p>

<p>“I am not sneaking&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Rotten soldier stuff&mdash;you should be shot down.”</p>

<p>“I am not a soldier&mdash;I am a ploughman.”</p>

<p>“You are here to fight&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“They forced me to come&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Forced you to fight for your Fatherland?”</p>

<p>“This is not my Fatherland, but a strange country&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You are here for the Fatherland&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I have six children in Russia. The Fatherland is
not feeding them. My field is not ploughed.”</p>

<p>The talk had crackled; it had required but a few
seconds; Luban had done it all for Fallows to see and
hear&mdash;but Fallows was very far from observing the pose
of that weakling. The Ploughman held him heart and
soul&mdash;as did the infallible and instantly unerring truth
of his words. The world’s poor, the world’s degraded,
had found its voice.</p>

<p>The man was white with truth, like a priest of Melchizedek.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span></p>
<p>Luban must have broken altogether. Fallows, listening,
watching the Ploughman with his soul, did not turn....
Now the man’s face changed. The lips parted
strangely, the eyelids lifting. Whiteness wavered between
the eyes of the Ploughman and the eyes of Duke Fallows.
Luban’s pistol crashed and the man fell with a
sob.</p>

<p>Fallows was kneeling among the soaked roots of the
millet, holding the soldier in his arms:</p>

<p>“Living God, to die for you&mdash;you, who are so straight
and so young.... Hear me&mdash;don’t go yet&mdash;I must
have your name, Brother.... Luban did not know
you&mdash;he is just a little sick man&mdash;he didn’t know you or
he wouldn’t have done this.... Tell me your name ...
and the place of your babes, and their mother....
Oh, be sure they shall be fed&mdash;glad and proud
am I to do that easy thing!... You have shown me
the Nearer God.... They shall be fed, and they
shall hear! The world, cities and nations, all who suffer,
shall hear what the Ploughman said&mdash;the soul of the
Ploughman, who is the hope of the world.... You
have spoken for Russia.... And now rest&mdash;rest,
Big Brother&mdash;you have done your work.”</p>

<p>The soldier looked up to him. There had been pain
and wrenching, the vision of a desolated house. Now,
his eyes rested upon the American. The shadow of death
lifted. He saw his brother in the eyes that held him&mdash;his
brother, and it seemed, the Son of Man smiled there
behind the tears.... He smiled back like a weary
child. Peace came to him, lustrous from the shadow,
for lo! his field was ploughed and children sang in his
house.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Fallows had not risen from his knees. He was talking
to himself:</p>

<p>“... Out of the grain he came&mdash;the soul of the
Ploughman. And gently he spoke to us ... and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>this is the day of the battle. I came to the battle&mdash;and
I go to carry his message to the poor&mdash;to those who
labor&mdash;to Russia and the America of the future. Luban
spoke the thought of the world, but the Ploughman spoke
for humanity risen. He spoke for the women, and for
the poor.... Bright he came from the grain&mdash;bright
and unafraid&mdash;and those shall hear him, who suffer
and are heavy-laden. This is the battle!...
And his voice came to me&mdash;a great and gracious voice&mdash;for
tsars and kings and princes to hear&mdash;and I am to
carry his message....”</p>

<p>Luban laughed feebly at last, and Fallows looked up
to him.</p>

<p>“You’ll hear him in your passing, Luban, poor lad.
You’ll hear him in your hell. Until you are as simple
and as pure as this Ploughman&mdash;you shall hear and see
all this again. Though you should hang by the neck to-night,
Luban,&mdash;this picture would go out with you. For
this is the hour you killed your Christ.”</p>

<p class="ph2">12</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">L</span>owenkampf</span> was the name that meant defeat.
Lowenkampf&mdash;it was like the rain that night....
“Lowenkampf started out too soon.”...
Morning heard it. Fallows heard it. The coughing sentries
heard it. The whole dismal swamp of drenched,
whipped soldiery heard it. Sleek History had awakened
to grasp it; Kuropatkin had washed his hands....
Lowenkampf had started out too soon that morning. The
Siberians had only left Yentai Station proper when Lowenkampf
set forth from the Coal-heights. Had his supports
been in position (very quickly and clearly the
world’s war-experts would see this) the rout in the grain
would have been checked.</p>

<p>As it was, many of Lowenkampf’s soldiers had run
the entire ten miles from the heights to the station, Yentai&mdash;after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
emerging from <i>kao-liang</i>&mdash;evading the Siberian
supports as they ran, as chaos flies from order.
Now in the darkness (with Kuroki bivouacked upon the
main trophy of the day, the Coal-heights) the shamed
battalions of Lowenkampf re-formed along the main line
in the midst of their unused reserves.</p>

<p>The day had been like a month of fever to Morning,
but Duke Fallows was a younger man, and a stranger
that night.... Morning tried to work, but he was
too close to it all, too tired. It was as if he were trying
to tell of a misfortune that had no beginning, and whose
every phase was his own heart’s concern. His weariness
was like the beginning of death&mdash;coldness and pervading
<i>ennui</i>. Against his will he was gathered in the glowing
currents of Duke Fallows&mdash;watching, listening, not pretending
even to understand, but borne along. Together
they went in to the General’s private room. Lowenkampf
looked up, gathered himself with difficulty and smiled.
Fallows turned to Morning, asked him to stand by the
door, then strode forward and knelt by the General’s
knees. It did not seem extraordinary to Morning&mdash;so
much was insane.</p>

<p>“You were chosen, old friend. It has been a big day
for the under-dog&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I have lost Liaoyang.”</p>

<p>“That was written.”</p>

<p>“My little boy will hear it in the street. He will hear
it in the school. Before he is a man&mdash;he will hear it.”</p>

<p>“I shall take him upon my knee. I shall tell him of
you in a way that he shall never forget. And his mother&mdash;I
shall tell her&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Lowenkampf rubbed his eyes.</p>

<p>“I have business in Russia. This day I heard what
must be done. It is almost as if I had gotten to be a
man.”</p>

<p>Fallows leaned back laughingly, his arms extended,
as if pushing the other’s knees from him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span></p>

<p>Some inner wall broke, and the General wept. Morning
put his foot against the door. The thought in his
heart was: “This is something I cannot write.”...</p>

<p>Morning held the idea coldly now that Fallows was
mentally softened from the strain. Other things came up
to support it.... He, too, had seen a soldier shot
by an officer. It was discipline. At best, it was but one of
the thousand pictures. It had happened less because the
man was retiring without a wound&mdash;thousands were doing
that&mdash;than because the man answered back, when the
officer spoke. He did not hear what the soldier said.
This soldier possibly had trans-Baikal children, too. The
day and his long illness had crazed Fallows, now at the
knees of the man who had lost the battle.</p>

<p>“...  I know what you thought this morning&mdash;when
you saw your men march down into the grain,”
Fallows was saying to the General. “You thought of
your little boy and his mother. You thought of the
babes and wives and mothers&mdash;of those soldiers of yours
whom you were sending to the front. You didn’t want
to send them out. You’re too close to becoming a man
for that. You wondered if you would not have to suffer
for sending them out so&mdash;and if this particular suffering
would not have to do with <i>your</i> little boy and his
mother&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“My God, stop, Fallows&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You had to think that. You wouldn’t be Lowenkampf
if you failed to think that.... I love you
for it, old friend. Big things will come from Lowenkampf,
and from the conscript who came to me out of
the grain with vision and a voice. The battle at home
won’t be so hard to win&mdash;now that this is lost.”</p>

<p>There was a challenge and heavy steps on the platform&mdash;and
one low, hurried voice.</p>

<p>Lowenkampf stood up and wiped his eyes.</p>

<p>“The Commander&mdash;&mdash;” he whispered.</p>

<p>A pair of captains towered above him, a grizzled
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>colonel behind; then Morning saw the gray of the short
beard, and the dark, dry-burning of unblinking eyes,
fixed upon Lowenkampf.... The latter’s shoulders
drooped a little, and his eyes lowered deprecatingly
for just an instant. Kuropatkin passed in. The soft
fullness of his shoulders was like a woman’s. Fleshly
and failing, he looked, from behind.... The Americans
waited outside with the colonel and captains. The
door was shut.</p>

<p>Midnight.... Fallows and Morning had moved
in the rain among the different commands. The army
at Yentai seemed to be emerging from prolonged anæsthesia
to find itself missing in part and strangely disordered.
It was afraid to sleep, afraid to think of itself,
and denied drink. Fallows had told everywhere the
story of the Ploughman; just now he helped himself to
a bundle of Morning’s Chinese parchment, and was writing
copy in long-hand.</p>

<p>His head was bowed, his eyes expressionless.</p>

<p>“And I alone remain to tell thee!” he muttered at
last.</p>

<p>Morning did not answer, but resigned himself to hear
more of the Messiah who came out of the grain.</p>

<p>“I told one of Mergenthaler’s aides the story,” Fallows
said coldly. “He said it was quite the proper thing
to do&mdash;to shoot down a man who was leaving the field
unwounded. I told Manlewson of the First Siberians,
who replied that the Russians would begin to win battles
when they murdered all such, as unflinchingly and instantly
as the Japanese did, and hospital malingerers as
well. I told Bibinoff (who is Luban’s captain), and he
said: ‘That’s the first good thing I ever heard about
Luban.’ He was pleased and epigrammatic....”</p>

<p>Fallows stood up&mdash;his face was in shadow, so far beneath
was the odorous lamp.</p>

<p>“Living God&mdash;I can’t make them see&mdash;I can’t
make them see! They’re all enchanted. Or else I’m
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>dead and this is hell.... They talk about Country.
They talk about making a man stand in a place of sure
death for his Country&mdash;in this Twentieth Century&mdash;when
war has lost its last vestige of meaning to the man in the
ranks, and his Country is a thing of rottenness and moral
desolation! What is the Country to the man in the
ranks? A group of corrupt, inbred undermen who study
to sate themselves&mdash;to tickle and soften themselves&mdash;with
the property and blood and slavery of the poor....
A good man, a clean man, is torn from his house to
fight, to stand in the fire-pits and die for such monsters.
Suddenly the poor man sees!</p>

<p>“...  He came forth from the grain with vision&mdash;smiling
and unafraid. He is not afraid to fight, but he
has found himself on the wrong side of the battle. When
he fights again it will be for his child, for his house, for
his brother, for his woman, for his soul. Blood in plenty
has he for such a war.... Think of it, John Morning,
the Empire was entrusted to poor little Luban&mdash;against
this man of vision! He came forth smiling from
the grain. ‘<i>I do not belong here, my masters. I was
torn away from my woman and children, and I must be
home for the winter ploughing. It is a long way&mdash;and
I must be off. I am a ploughman, not a soldier. I
belong to my children and my field. My country does
not plough my field&mdash;does not feed my children....</i>
What could Luban do but kill him&mdash;little agent of
Herod? But the starry child lives!...</p>

<p>“And listen, John, to-night&mdash;you heard them&mdash;we
heard these fat-necked, vulture-breasted commanders&mdash;vain,
envy-poisoned, scandal-mongering commanders,
complaining to each other: ‘See, what stuff has been
given us to win battles with!... I have told it and
they cannot see. They are not even good devils; they
are not decent devourers. They have no humor&mdash;that is
their deadly sin. An adult, half-human murderer, seeing
his soldiers leave the field, would cry aloud, ‘Hello, you
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>Innocents&mdash;so you have wakened up at last!’ But these
cannot see. Their eyes are stuck together. It is their
deadly sin&mdash;the sin against the Holy Ghost&mdash;to lack
humor to this extent!”</p>

<p>Morning laughed strangely. “Come on to bed, you
old anarchist,” he said, though sleep was far from his
own eyes.</p>

<p>“That’s it, John. Anarchy. In the name of Fatherland,
Russia murders a hundred thousand workmen out
here in Asia. In answer, a few men and women gather
together in a Petersburg cellar, saying, ‘We are fools, not
heroes. When we fight again it will be for <i>Our</i> Country!’
And they are anarchists&mdash;their cause is Terrorism!”</p>

<p>“We’re all shot to pieces to-night, Duke&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“We are alive, John. Lowenkampf is alive. But he
who spoke to me this day, who came forth so blithely to
die in my arms (his woman sleeps ill to-night in the
midst of her babes), and he is lying out in the rain, his
face turned up to the rain. God damn the fat reptile
that calls itself Fatherland!... But, I say to you,
that we’re come nearly to the end of the prince and
pauper business on this planet. The soul of the Ploughman
was heard to-day&mdash;as long ago they heard the Soul
of the Carpenter.... He is lying out there in the
millet&mdash;his face turned up to the rain. Yet I say to you,
John, there’s more life in him this hour than in his Tsar
and all the princes of the blood.”</p>

<p>Fallows covered his face with his hands.</p>

<p>“You’re tired and thick to-night, John, but you are
one who must see!” he finished passionately. “You must
help me tell the story to the cellar gatherings in Petersburg,
to the secret meetings in all the centers of misery,
wherever a few are gathered together in the name of
Brotherhood&mdash;in New York, London, Paris, and Berlin....
You must help me to make other men see&mdash;help
me to tell this thing so that the world will hear it, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>with such power that the world will be unable longer
to lie to itself.</p>

<p>“I can see it now&mdash;how Jesus, the Christ, tried to
make men see.... That was His Gethsemane&mdash;that
He could not make men see. I tell you it is a God’s
work&mdash;and it came to Jesus, the Christ, at last&mdash;‘If they
crucify me, perhaps, a few will see!’... I’m going
over to Russia, John, to learn how to tell them better.”</p>

<p class="ph2">13</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> night of the third of September, and John
Morning is off for the big adventure. Between
the hills, the roads are a-stream.... All day he
had watched different phases of the retreat. Fighting
back in the city; fighting here and there along the staggering,
burdened, cruelly-punished line; a sudden breaking-out
of fighting in a dozen places like hidden fires;
rain and wounded and seas of mud; the gray intolerable
misery of it all; the sick and the dead&mdash;Morning was
glutted with the colossal derangement. And they called
it an orderly retreat.</p>

<p>He was riding the sorrel Eve out of the zone of war.
The battle was behind him now, and he breathed the
world again. He had something to tell. Liaoyang was
in his brain. He was off for the ships that sail. A month&mdash;America&mdash;the
great story.... He felt the manuscript
against him. It was in a Chinese belt, with money
for the passage home, tight against his body, a hundred
thousand words done on Chinese parchment and wrapped
in oil-skin. The book of Liaoyang&mdash;he had earned it.
He had written it against the warping cynicism of Duke
Fallows. On the ship he could reshape and renew it
all into a master-picture.</p>

<p>It had been easier than he thought to break away
from Fallows, his friend. The latter was whelmed in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>the soul of the Ploughman. A big story, of course, as
Fallows saw it&mdash;but there were scores of big stories.
It would ruin it to let an anarchist tell it. Suppose
officers in general did stop to listen to troops sneaking
off the field?</p>

<p>Duke had given him a letter, and a story for the
<i>Western States</i>. The first was not to be read until he
was at sea out from Japan. When Morning spoke of
the money he owed, the other had put the thought away.
Sometime he would call for it if he needed it; it was a
trifle anyway.... It hadn’t been a trifle. It had
meant everything.</p>

<p>Morning was glad to breathe himself again. Yet
there was an ache in his heart for Duke Fallows, now
off for Europe the western way. He, Morning, had not
done his part. He hadn’t given as he had taken; had
not kept close to Duke Fallows at the last. There was
a big score that money could never settle. Soundly glad
to be alone, but in the very gladness the picture of Duke
Fallows returned&mdash;lying on his back, in bunks and berths
and beds, staring up at the ceiling, accentuating his own
failures to bring out the hopeful and valorous parts of
his friend. It was always such a picture to Morning,
when Fallows came to mind&mdash;staring, dreaming, looking
up from his back. It had seemed sometimes as if he
were trying to make of his friend all that he had failed
to be.... Yet the Duke Fallows of the last
twenty-four hours, wild, dithyrambic&mdash;had been too
much.... Again and again, irked and heavy with
his own limitations, Morning’s brain had seized upon the
weakness of the other, to condone his own slowness of
understanding.... It may have been Eve, and
her relation to the Fallows revelation, or it may have
been putting hideous militarism behind, that made John
Morning think of Women now as he rode, and a little
differently from ever before.... Certain laughing
sentences of Duke Fallows came back to him presently,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>with a point he seemed to have missed when they were
uttered:</p>

<p>“We have our devils, John. You have ambition;
Lowenkampf has drink; Mergenthaler has slaughter....
You will love a woman; you already drink too
readily, but Ambition will stand in your house and fight
from room to room at the last&mdash;and over the premises
to the last ditch. He’s a grand devil&mdash;is Ambition....
My devil, John? Well, it isn’t the big-jawed
male who loves a woman as she dreams to be loved.
It’s the man with a touch of women in him&mdash;just enough
to begin upon her mystery.... When I hear a certain
woman’s voice, or see a certain passing figure&mdash;something
old, very old and wise, stirs within, seems to
stir and thrill with eternal life. And, John, it isn’t low&mdash;the
thought. I’d tell you if it were. It isn’t low. It’s
as regal as Mother Nature in a valley, on a long afternoon.
It isn’t that I want to hurt her; it isn’t that I
want something she has. Rather, I want all she has!
I want her mind; I want her soul; I want her full animations.
I want to make her yield and give; I want to
feel her battle with herself, not to yield and give....
Oh, the flesh is nothing. It is the cheapest thing in the
world&mdash;but her giving, her yielding&mdash;it’s like an ocean
tide. It breaks every bond; it laughs at every law.
Power seems to rush into a woman when she yields!
That’s the conquest of my heart&mdash;to feel that power....
All devils are young compared to that in a man’s
heart&mdash;all but one, and that is the passion to hold spiritual
dominion over other men.”</p>

<p>Morning’s mind had fallen into the habit of allowing
much for the other’s sayings&mdash;of accepting much as
mere facility.... Thus he thought as he traveled
in the rain, Eve’s swift, springy trot a stimulus to deep
thinking; and always there was a bigger and finer John
Morning shadowing him, fathoming his smallnesses,
wondering at his puny rebellions and vain desires. It
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>was in this fairer John Morning, so tragically unexpressed
during the past few months, that the pang lived&mdash;the
pang of parting from his friend.</p>

<p>Morning was terrific physically. The thing he was
now doing was as spectacular a bit of newspaper service
as ever correspondent undertook in Asia; and yet, to
John Morning the high light of achievement fell upon
the manuscript, not upon the action. It had not occurred
to him to be afraid. If he could get across the ninety
miles to Koupangtse&mdash;through the <i>Hun huises</i>, through
the Japanese scouting cavalry, across two large and
many smaller yellow rivers&mdash;and reach the railroad, he
would quickly get a ship for Japan from Tientsin or
Tongu&mdash;and from Japan&mdash;<i>home</i>.... He was doing
it for himself&mdash;passionately and with no sense of
splendor.</p>

<p>Fallows had been so sure of his friend’s physical
courage, that he made no point of it, in the expression
of attachment.... He had called it vision at first,
this thing that had drawn him to John Morning&mdash;a touch
of the poet, a touch of the feminine&mdash;others might have
called it. No matter the name, he had seen it, as all
artists of the expression of the inner life recognize it in
one another; and Fallows knew well that where the
courage of the soldier ends, the courage of the visionary
begins.</p>

<p>Morning was a trifle peculiar, however. Unless it
sank utterly, he stuck to a ship, until the horizon revealed
another sail.</p>

<p>He had come up through the dark. The world had
grounded him deeply in illusion. Most brilliant of promises&mdash;even
Fallows had not seen him that first day in
too bright a dawn&mdash;but he learned hard. And his had
been close fighting&mdash;such desperate fighting that one does
not hear voices, and one is too deep in the ruck to see the
open distance.... Much as he had been alone&mdash;the
world had invariably shattered his silences. Always
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>he had worked&mdash;worked, worked furiously, angrily, for
himself.... He was taught so. The world had
caught him as a child in his brief, pitiful tenderness.
The world was his Eli. As from sleep, he had heard
Reality calling. He had risen to answer, but the false
Eli had spoken&mdash;an Eli that did not teach him truly to
listen, nor to say, when he heard the Voice another time&mdash;“Speak,
Lord, for thy servant heareth.”</p>

<p class="ph2">14</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> Taitse, of large and ancient establishment, runs
westward from Liaoyang for twenty-five miles,
and in a well-earned bed, portions of which are worn
in the rock. Morning rode along the north bank, thus
avoiding altogether a crossing of the Taitse, since his
journey continued westward from the point where the
river took its southward bend. From thence it paralleled
the Hun in a race to join the Liao. The main stem of
the latter was beyond the Hun, and these two arteries of
Asia broke Morning’s trail. Fording streams of such
magnitude was out of the question, and there was a
strong chance of an encounter with the <i>Hun huises</i> at
the ferries....</p>

<p>Rain, and the sorrel’s round hoofs sucked sharply in
the clay. She had no shoes to lose in these drawing
vacuums. The scent of her came up warm and good to
the horse-lover. Alone on a road, she had always been
manageable, hating crowds and noise&mdash;soldiers, Chinese,
and accoutrements. Perhaps, this was merely a biding
of time. Eve had a fine sense of keeping a strange road.
This was not usual, although a horse travels a familiar
road in the darkness better than a man. These two
worked well together.</p>

<p>By map the distance from Liaoyang to Koupangtse
was seventy miles. Morning counted upon ninety, at
least. The Manchurian roads are old and odd as the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>Oriental mind.... He passed the southward bend
of the big river, and at daybreak reached Chiensen, ten
miles beyond, on the Hun.</p>

<p>Chiensen, unavoidable on account of the ferry, was
a danger-point. Japanese cavalry, it was reported, frequently
lit there, and the <i>Hun huises</i> (Chinese river-pirates
and thieves in general, whom Alexieff designated
well as “the scourge of Manchuria”) were at base in
this village.... In the gray he found junks, a flat
tow and landing.</p>

<p>You never know what Chinese John is going to do.
If you have but little ground of language between you,
he will take his own way, on the pretext of misunderstanding.
Morning’s idea was to get across quickly,
without arousing the river-front. He awoke the ferryman,
placing three silver taels in his hand. (He carried
silver, enough native currency to get him to Japan, his
passport, and the two large envelopes Duke Fallows had
given him, in the hip-pockets of his riding breeches.)
The ferryman had no thought of making the first crossing
without tea. Morning labored with him, and with
seeming effect for a moment, but the other fell suddenly
from grace and aroused his family. He was not
delicate about it. Morning resigned himself to the delay,
and was firmly persuading Eve to be moderate, as
she drank from the river’s edge, when Chinese John
suddenly aroused the river population. Standing well
out on the tow-flat, he trumpeted at some comrade of
the night before, apparently no less than a hundred yards
up the river. There were sleepy answers from many
junks within range of the voice. It was the one hateful
thing to John Morning&mdash;yet to rough it with the ferryman
for his point of view would be the only thing worse.</p>

<p>The landing was rickety; its jointure with the tow-boat
imperfect. The American took off his coat, tossed
it over the sorrel’s head, tying the sleeves under her
throat. She stiffened in rebellion, but as the darkness
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>was as yet little broken by the day, she decided to accept
the situation. Morning felt her growing reluctance,
however, as she traversed the creaking, springy boards.
The crevasse between the landing and the craft was
bridged; and the latter, grounded on the shore-side, did
not give. The mare stood in the center of the tow,
sweating and tense.</p>

<p>Numerous Chinese were now abroad&mdash;eager, even insistent,
to help. Their voices stirred the mare to her
old red-eyed insanity. Morning could hold himself no
longer. Once or twice before in his life this hard, bright
light had come to his brain. Though the exterior light
was imperfect, the ferryman saw the fingers close upon
the butt of the gun, and something of the American’s
look. He dropped his tea, sprang to the junk and pulled
up the bamboo-sail. This was used to hold the tow
against the current.</p>

<p>Two natives in the flat-boat stood ready with poles.
And now the ferryman spoke in a surprised and disappointed
way as he toiled in front. He seemed ready to
burst into tears; and the two nearer Morning grunted
in majors and minors, according to temperament. The
American considered that it might all be innocent, although
the voices were many from the town-front. Poling
began; the tow drew off from the landing. Clear
from the grounding of the shore, the craft sank windily
to its balance in the stream.</p>

<p>This was too much for Eve. Her devil was in the
empty saddle. She leaped up pawing. The two Chinese
at the poles dived over side abruptly. Water
splashed Eve’s flanks, and she veered about on her hind
feet&mdash;blinded and striking the air in front. The wobble
of the tow now finished her frenzy&mdash;and back she went
into the stream. The saddle saved her spine from a
gash on the edge of the tow. Morning had this thought
when Eve arose; that he need fear no treachery from the
Chinese; and this as she fell&mdash;a queer, cool, laughing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>thought&mdash;that after such a fall she would never walk like
a man again.</p>

<p>He had been forced to drop the bridle, but caught it
luckily with one of the poles as she came up struggling.
He beckoned the ferryman forward, and Eve, swimming
and fighting, was towed across. To Morning it was like
one of his adventures back in the days of the race-horse
shipping.</p>

<p>Eve struck the opposite bank&mdash;half-strangled from
her struggle and the blind. The day had come. The
nameless little town on this side of the Hun was out to
meet him. Had he brought a Korean tiger by a string,
however, he could not have enjoyed more space&mdash;as the
mare climbed from the stream. He talked to her and
unbound her eyes. Red and deeply baleful they were.
She shook her head and parted her jaws. The circle of
natives widened. Morning straightened the saddle and
patted Eve’s neck softly, talking modestly of her exploit....
Natives were now hailing from mid-stream, so
he leaped into the sticky saddle and guided the mare
out to the main road leading to Tawan on the Liao....
Queerly enough, just at this instant, he remembered
the hands and the lips of the ferryman&mdash;a leper.</p>

<p>Ten miles on the map&mdash;he could count thirteen by
the road&mdash;and then the Liao crossing.... The
mare pounded on until they came to a wild hollow, rock-strewn,
among deserted hills. Morning drew up, cooled
his mount and fed the soaked grain strapped to the saddle
since the night before. Eve was not too cross to
eat&mdash;nor too tired. She lifted her head often and drew
in the air with the sound of a bubble-pipe....
Just now Morning noted a wrinkle in his saddle blanket.
Hot with dread, he loosed the girth.</p>

<p>He looked around in terror lest anyone see his own
shame and fear. He had put the saddle on in the dark,
but passed his hand between her back and the cloth.
Long ago a trainer had whipped him for a bad bit of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>saddling; even at the time he had felt the whipping deserved.
He lifted the saddle. A pink scalded mouth
the size of a twenty-five-cent piece was there....
God, if he could only be whipped now. She was sensitive
as satin; it was only a little wrinkle of the rain-soaked
blanket.... His voice whimpered as he
spoke to her.</p>

<p>Only a horseman could have suffered so. He washed
the rub, packed soft lint from a Russian first-aid bandage
about to ease the pressure; and then, since the rain
had stopped again, he rubbed her dry and walked at her
head for hours, despairing at last of the town named
Tawan. The Liao was visible before the village itself.
Morning shook with fatigue. He had to gain the saddle
for the possible need of swift action, but the wound
beneath never left his mind. It uncentered his self-confidence&mdash;a
force badly needed now.</p>

<p>And this was the Liao&mdash;the last big river, roughly
half-way. The end of the war-zone, it was, too, but the
bright point of peril from <i>Hun huises</i>.... Morning
saw the thin masts of the river junks over the bowl
of the hill, their tribute flags flying.... To pass
was the day’s work, to make the ferry with Eve. There
was too much misery and contrition in his heart for him
to handle her roughly. The blind could not be used
again. She would connect that with the back-fall into
the Hun. The town was full of voices.</p>

<p class="ph2">15</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">C</span>hinese</span> were gathering. Morning went about his
business as if all were well, but nothing was good
to him about the increase of these hard, quick-handed
men. They were almost like Japanese. With the tail
of his eye, he saw shirt signals across the river. The
main junk fleet was opposite. Trouble&mdash;he knew it.
The hard, bright light was in his brain.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span></p>
<p>In the gathering of the natives, Eve was roused
afresh. His only way was to try her without the blind.
If she showed fight, he meant to mount quickly and ride
back through the crowd for one of the lower-town
crossings.</p>

<p>Without looking back, he led the way to the landing,
holding just the weight of the bridle-rein. His arm
gave with her every hesitation. To his amazement she
consented to try. The tow-craft was larger here&mdash;enough
for a bullock-pair and cart&mdash;and better fitted to
the landing. Step by step she went with him to her
place.</p>

<p>Now Morning saw that in using the blind the first
time he had done her another injury. She would not
have gone back into the Hun but for that. She awed
him. Something Fallows had said recurred&mdash;about her
being unconquerable, different every day. Also Fallows
had said, “She will kill you at the last....”</p>

<p>He drove back the Chinese, all but two pole-men, that
would have gathered on the tow. This was quietly done,
but his inflexibility was felt. Many signals were sent
across, as the tow receded from the shore, and numbers
increased on the opposite bank.</p>

<p>Eve, breathing audibly, swung forward and back with
the craft, as it gave to the river. The towing junk, as
in the Hun, held the other against the current; the rest
was poling and paddling.... The junk itself
slipped out of the way as the tow was warped toward
the landing. Other junks were stealing in....
Morning already had paid. He felt the girth of the
saddle, fingered the bridle, tightened his belt. A warm,
gray day, but he was spent and gaunt and cold. Eve
was hushed&mdash;mulling her bit softly, trembling with
hatred for the Chinese.</p>

<p>The road ascended from the river, through a narrow
gorge with rocky walls. The river-men were woven
across the way. While the tow was yet fifteen feet from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>the landing, Morning gained the saddle. The ferry-man
gestured frantically that this had never been done before;
that a man’s beast properly should be led across.
Morning laughed, tightened his knees, and at an early
instant loosened the bridle-rein, for the mare to jump.
The heavy tow shot back as she cleared the fissure of
stream.</p>

<p>Morning was now caught in the blur of events. The
Chinese did not give way for the mare, as she trotted
across the boards to the rocky shore. Up she went striking.
Again he had not known Eve. The back-dive into
the Hun had not cured her. She would walk like a man
and pitch back into Hell&mdash;and do it again....
Someone knifed her from the side and she toppled.</p>

<p>The fall was swift and terrible, for the trail sloped
behind. Morning’s instinct was truer than his brain,
but there was no choice of way to jump. He could not
push the mare from him completely to avoid the cliff.
He was half-stunned against the wall, and not clear
from the struggle of her fall. The brain is never able
to report this instant afterward, even though consciousness
is not lost. He was struck, trampled; he felt the
cold of the rock against his breast, and the burn of a
knife.</p>

<p>The Chinese struck at him as he rose. The mare
was up, facing him, but dragging him upward, as a dog
with a bone. His left hand found the pistol. He cleared
the Chinese from him, emptying the chambers....
Eve let him come to her. He must have gained the
saddle as she swung around in the narrow gorge to begin
her run. The wind rushed coldly across his
breast and abdomen. His shirt had been cut and pulled
free. It was covered with blood. He tried to hold the
mare, but either his strength was gone or she was past
feeling the bit. It was her hour. All Morning could
do was to keep the road.</p>

<p>He was all but knocked out. He had mounted as a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>fighter gets up under the count&mdash;and fights on without
exactly knowing. The mare was running head down.
He tried his strength again. The reins were rigid; she
had the bit and meant to end the game.... He
loved her wild heart; mourned for her; called her name;
told her of wrongs he had done. Again and again, the
light went from him; sometimes he drooped forward to
her thin, short mane, and clung there, but the heat of
her made him ill. They came into hills, passed tiny villages.
It was all strange and terrible&mdash;a hurtling from
high heaven.... Eve was like a furnace....</p>

<p>And now she was weaving on the road&mdash;running
drunkenly, unless his eyes betrayed.... The rushing
wind was cold upon his breast. His coat was gone;
his shirt had been cut. He tried to pull the blood-soaked
ends together. At this moment the blow
fell.</p>

<p>These Chinese had been quick-handed, and they knew
where to search for a man’s goods. He was coldly sane
in an instant, for the rending of his whole nature; then
came the quick zeal for death&mdash;the intolerableness of
living an instant. The wallet&mdash;the big story&mdash;some hundreds
of tales in paper! It was the passing of these
from next his body that had left him cold.... Fury
must have come to his arms. The mare lifted her head
under his sudden attack.</p>

<p>Yes, he could manage her now. The bloody mouth
and the blind-mad head came up to him&mdash;her front legs
giving like a colt’s. Down they went together. Morning
took his fall limply, with something of supremely
organized indifference, and turned in the mud to the
mare.</p>

<p>She was dead. The gray of pearl was in her eyes
where red life had been.... No, she raised herself
forward, seemed to be searching for him, her muzzle
sickly relaxed. She could not stir behind. Holding
there for a second&mdash;John Morning forgot the big story.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span></p>
<p>Eve fell again. He crawled to her&mdash;tried to lift her
head. It was heavy as a sheet-anchor to his arms....
Her heart had broken. She had died on her
feet&mdash;the last rising was but a galvanism.... He
looked up into the gray sky where the clouds stirred
sleepily. He wanted to ask something from something
there.... He could not think of what he wanted....
Oh, yes, his book of Liaoyang.</p>

<p>And now his eye roved over the mare.... Her
hind legs were sheeted with fresh blood and clotted with
dry.... Desperately he craned about to see further.
Entrails were protruding from a knife wound.
The inner tissues were not cut, but the opened gash had
let them sag horribly. She had run from Tawan with
that wound.... He had worn her to the quick in
night; blinded her for the Hun crossing, when she would
have done nobly with eyes uncovered.... He had
not been able to keep her from killing herself....
John Morning, the horseman.... He had left a
gaping wound in the spirit of Duke Fallows....
All that he had done was failure and loss; all that he
had planned so passionately, so brutally, indeed, that
the needs and the offerings of others had not reached his
heart, because of the iron self-purpose weighed there.</p>

<p>Luban, Lowenkampf, Mergenthaler, even the Commander-in-chief,
looked strangely in through the darkened
windows of his mind. The moral suffocation of
the grain-fields surged over him again.... He
caught a glimpse of that last moment in the ravine, but
not the taking of the wallet.... Was it just a
dream that a native leaped forward to grasp his stirrup,
and that he leaned down to fire? He seemed to recall
the altered brow.</p>

<p>The pictures came too fast. The sky did not change.
The something did not answer.... Eve was lying
in the mud. She looked darker and huddled. He kissed
her face, and as he gained his feet, the thought came
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>queerly that <i>he</i> might be dead, as she was. He held the
thought of action to his limbs and made them move.</p>

<p>When he could think more clearly, he scorned the
pain and protest of his limbs. He would not be less
than Eve. If he were not dead, he would die straight
up, and on the road to Koupangtse.</p>

<p class="ph2">16</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>hirty-six</span> hours after Morning left Eve, an
English correspondent at Shanhaikwan added the
following to a long descriptive letter made up of refugee
tales, and the edges and hearsay of the war-zone:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Night of Sept. 5.... An American whose
name by passport is John Morning reached here to-night
on the <i>Chinese Eastern</i>, having left Koupangtse
this morning. According to his story, he was with
the Russians, now in retreat from Liaoyang, on the
night of Sept. 3, only forty-eight hours from this
writing.</p>

<p>Morning was in an unconscious condition upon
arrival. His passage had been fourth-class for the
journey, and he was packed among the coolies and
refugees on an open flat-car so crowded that all but
the desperately fatigued had room only to stand.
This white man had fallen to the floor of the car,
among the bare feet of the surging Oriental crowd,
beneath their foul garments.</p>

<p>... He was lifted forth from the car by the
Chinese&mdash;a spectacle abjectly human, covered with
filth; moreover, his body was incredibly bruised, his
left puttee legging torn by a deep knife-wound that
began at the knee, and traversed a distance of eight
inches downward&mdash;the whole was gummed and black
with blood; another knife-wound in his side was in
an angry condition, and his clothing was stiffened
from flow of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span></p>

<p>A few <i>taels</i> in paper and silver were found upon
him; the passport, an unopened letter addressed to
himself; also a manuscript addressed to a San Francisco
paper, and to be delivered by John Morning.
The natives reported that he had reached Koupangtse
an hour before the arrival of the <i>Chinese Eastern</i>;
had employed a native to buy him fourth-class passage,
paying the native also to help him aboard. He
had collapsed, however, until actually among the Chinese
on the flat-car. He had tasted neither food nor
drink during the long day’s journey, nor in Koupangtse
during the wait. The natives affirm that he
crawled part of the distance up to the railway station;
and that there were no English or Americans
there.</p>

<p>Upon reaching here, Morning was revived with
stimulants, his wounds bathed and dressed, fresh
clothing provided. His extraordinary vitality and
courage indicate that he will overcome the shocks
and exhaustion of a journey hardly paralleled anywhere,
if his story be true. He asserts that he must
be on his way to Tientsin to-morrow morning&mdash;but
that, of course, is impossible.... He is not in
condition to answer questions, although undoubtedly
much is in his dazed and stricken brain for which
the world is at this moment waiting.</p>

<p>In his half-delirium, Morning seems occupied with
the loss of a certain sorrel mare. He also reports
the loss of his complete story of the battle, the preliminary
fighting, the generals in character sketch,
the terrain and all, covering a period of four months
up to the moment of General Zarubaieff’s withdrawal
from the city proper. This manuscript, said to contain
over a hundred thousand words done on Chinese
parchment, was in a wallet with the writer’s money,
and was cut from him in the struggle on the bank of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>the Liao, when the wounds were received. His assailants
were doubtless <i>Hun huises</i>.</p>

<p>Whatever can be said about the irrational parts
of his story, the young man appears to know the
story of the battle from the Russian standpoint. He
brings the peculiar point of view that it was the
millet that defeated the Russians, although the superiority
of the Japanese in <i>morale</i>, markmanship,
fluidity, is well known, etc.</p>
</div>

<p>... Morning lay in a decent room at the Rest
House in Shanhaikwan. There seemed an ivory finger
in his brain pointing to the sea&mdash;to Japan, to the States.
So long as he was walking, riding, entrained, all was
well enough, and the rest was mere body that had to
obey&mdash;but when he stopped, the ivory finger grew hot
or icy by turns; and as now, he watched in agony for
the day and the departure of the train for Tientsin.</p>

<p>He would require help. Below the waist he was excruciating
wreckage that for the present would not answer
his will.... They were good to him here.
The Chinese coolies had been good to him on the open
car.... Lowenkampf, Fallows, good to him&mdash;so
his thoughts ran&mdash;the sorrel Eve was his own heart’s
mate. He loved her running, dying, striking. She had
run until her heart broke. He could not do less. She
had run until she was past pain&mdash;he must do that&mdash;and
go on after that.... Was it still in his brain&mdash;the
great story? Would it clear and write itself&mdash;the great
story?</p>

<p>That was the question. All was well if he could get
Liaoyang out in words. He would do it all over again
on the ship. Every day the ship would be carrying him
closer to the States. He was still on schedule. He
would reach America on the first possible ship after the
battle of Liaoyang&mdash;possibly, ahead of mails. On the
voyage he would re-do the book&mdash;twenty days&mdash;five
thousand words a day. He might do it better. It might
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>come up clean out of the journey, the battle itself and
the pictures strengthened, brightened, impregnated with
fresh power.... Three weeks&mdash;every moment sailing
to the States&mdash;the first and fastest ship!...
The driving devil in his brain would be at rest. The big
story would clear, as he began to write. The days of
labor at first would change to days of pure instrumentation.
He would drive at first&mdash;then the task would drive
him.... But he must not miss a possible day to Japan&mdash;to
Nagasaki.... He had not money for the
passage to America. At this very moment he could not
get out of bed&mdash;but these two were mere pups compared
to the wolves he had met....</p>

<p>They found him on the floor drawing on his clothes
in the morning&mdash;an hour before the train. His wounds
were bleeding, but he laughed at that.</p>

<p>“You see, I’ve got to make it. You’ve been very
kind. I’ll heal on the way&mdash;not here. I’ve got the big
story. I’ve got to keep moving to think it out. I can’t
think here. I’ll get on&mdash;thank you.”</p>

<p>And he was on. That night his train stopped for
ten minutes at Tongu, the town near the Taku Forts, at
the mouth of the Pei-ho.... All day he had considered
the chance of getting ship here, without going
on to Tientsin, seventy miles up-river. The larger ships
lightered their traffic from Tongu; he might catch a
steamer sailing to-night for Japan, or at least for Chifu....
It was getting dark.</p>

<p>The face that looked through the barred window at
the Englishman in charge of the station at Tongu unsettled
the latter’s evening and many evenings afterward.</p>

<p>“Is there a ship from the river-mouth to-night?”</p>

<p>Morning repeated his question, and perceived that
the agent had dropped his eyes to the two hands holding
the ticket-shelf. Morning’s nails were tight in the wood;
he would wobble if he let go.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, there’s the little <i>Tungsheng</i>. She goes off to-night&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“For Japan?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but she doesn’t carry passengers&mdash;that is&mdash;unless
the Captain gives up his quarters, and he has
already done that this trip.”</p>

<p>“Deck passengers&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Sure, all carry coolies out of here&mdash;best freight we
have.”</p>

<p>“Do you sell the tickets?”</p>

<p>“Who’s going?”</p>

<p>“My servant.... I won’t go on to Tientsin if
I can get&mdash;get him on to-night&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“The launch and lighter are supposed to be down
shortly from Tientsin&mdash;that’s all I can say. It’s blowing
a bit. She may not clear.”</p>

<p>“She’ll clear if any does?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Himmelhock has taken her out of here worse
than this. You’d better decide&mdash;I’ve got to go out now.
The train’s leaving.”</p>

<p>Seventy miles up the river, he thought,&mdash;the wrong
way if he stuck to the train. Every mile that ivory finger
would torture him. His brain now seemed holding
back an avalanche. If he chose falsely, he would tumble
down the blackness with the rocks and glaciers....
This Englishman looked a gamester&mdash;he might help.
Perhaps he wasn’t a corpse.</p>

<p>“I’ll stay,” he said, and the story and all his purpose
wobbled and grew black.... He mustn’t forget.
He mustn’t fall.... So he stood there holding fast
to the ticket-shelf, which he could not feel&mdash;held and
held, and the train clattered, grew silent, and it was
dark.</p>

<p>“Where’s your servant?”</p>

<p>Morning’s lips moved.</p>

<p>“Where is your servant?”</p>

<p>“I am my servant.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span></p>

<p>“I can’t give a white man deck passage. It’s not
only against the rules&mdash;but against reason.”</p>

<p>Morning groped for his arm. “Take me into the
light,” he said.</p>

<p>The man obeyed.</p>

<p>“What day is this?”</p>

<p>“Night of September six.”</p>

<p>“I left Liaoyang the night of the third. I rode a good
horse to death&mdash;along the Taitse, over the Hun and the
Liao. I rode through the <i>Hun huises</i> twice. I was all
cut up and beaten&mdash;the horse went over backward in the
Hun, and in the gut on the bank of the Liao.... I
was in Liaoyang for the battle. I was there four months
waiting for the battle. They took my story&mdash;hundred
thousand words&mdash;the <i>Hun huises</i> did, in the fight on the
Liao bank. The horse killed herself running with me
... but I’ve got it all in my head&mdash;the story. I’ll
get to the States with it before any mail&mdash;before any
other man. It’s all in my head&mdash;the whole Russian-end.
I can write it again on the ship to the States in three
weeks.... I’ve got to get off to-night. You’re the
one to help me.... See these&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Morning opened his shirt and then started to undo
his legging.</p>

<p>“For God’s sake&mdash;don’t.... But you’ll die on
the deck&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No, the only way to kill me would be to wall me
up&mdash;so I couldn’t keep moving.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go down to the river with you in a few minutes.”</p>

<p>And then he had John Morning sobbing on his
shoulder.</p>

<p class="ph2">17</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> Englishman at Tongu was a small, sallow man,
with the face of one who is used to getting the
worst of it. Tongu, as a post, was no exception from
an outsider’s point of view. Morning saw this face in
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>odd lights during the days that followed. It came to the
chamber of images&mdash;and always he wanted to break
down, and his hands went out for the shoulder....
He remembered a pitching junk in the windy blackness
at the mouth of the Pei-ho. (He had seen the low mud-flats
of the Taku forts from here in another service.)...
The <i>Tungsheng</i> looked little&mdash;not much bigger
than the junk, and she was wooden. There was chill
and a slap of rain in the blackness.</p>

<p>“Hul-lo, who is dere?” The slow, juicy voice came
from the door of the pilot-house.</p>

<p>“Endicott. I’ve got a deck passenger&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Huh&mdash;dere dick as meggots alretty&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“This is a kitchen coolie of mine&mdash;he must go. Send
someone down to make a place and take his transportation&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The grumbling that followed was a matter of habit
rather than of effectiveness. Morning seemed to see the
lower lip from which the voice came, a thick and loppy
member.... The mate came down, stepping from
shoulder to back, across the complaining natives. They
were three deep on the deck. He kicked clear a hole
in the lee of the cabin.... Morning sank in, and
Endicott bent to whisper:</p>

<p>“Put the grub-basket between your knees and don’t
take your hands off it.... Put the blanket over it.
It’s a thick, good blanket. I could give you a better
passage, but they wouldn’t take you&mdash;honest, they
wouldn’t. If they see you’re white, tell old Himmelhock
you’re Endicott’s house-coolie. He can’t do anything
now.... If you live, write and send the big story
to Endicott at Tongu.”</p>

<p>Morning was sinking to sleep. He felt the warmth
of the blanket, a thick, rough blanket Endicott had donated.
Its warmth was like the man’s heart....
Morning’s hands went out. A coolie growled at him....
There was no worry now. It was the night of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>the sixth, and he was sailing. He could do no more;
the ivory finger in his brain neither froze nor burned....
The pitching did not rouse him&mdash;nor the men of
sewers and fields&mdash;sick where they sat&mdash;woven, matted
together, trusting to the animal heat of the mass to keep
from dying of exposure. John Morning lay in the midst
of them&mdash;John Morning whose body would not die.</p>

<p>The days and nights rushed together....</p>

<p>Sometimes he wondered if he were not back at the
shipping&mdash;in some stock-car with the horses&mdash;but horses
were so clean compared to this.... When he could
think, he put clean lint to his wounds. He scorned pain,
for he was on his way; and much was merciful coma.</p>

<p>There was rain, deluges; and though the air rose
heavy as amber afterward, the freshness at the time was
salvation. He learned as it is probable no other American
ever learned, what it means to live in the muck of
men. All one at the beginning and at the ending, it is
marvelous how men separate their lives in the interval&mdash;how
little they know of one another, and how easily
foolish noses turn up. Here was a man alive&mdash;dreaming
of the baths he had missed, of Japanese Inn baths
most of all.</p>

<p>“Who am I?” he asked.... “John Morning,”
would whip back to him from somewhere. “And who
in hell is John Morning to revolt at the sufferings of
other men?”</p>

<p>He had seen the coolies in the steerage of many ships&mdash;even
these massed deck passages of the Yellow and
China Seas and the Coasting trade. He had looked at
them before as one looks into a cage of animals. Now
he was one of those who looked out, one of the <i>slumees</i>.
Once he asked, “Is this the bottom of the human drain,
and if not&mdash;must I sink to it?”</p>

<p>The Chinese did steal his food that first night, but
fed him occasionally from their own stock. Finding him
white, they fouled him, but kept him warm....
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>The <i>Tungsheng</i> ran into Chifu harbor to avoid a storm,
and a full day was lost. John Morning had no philosophy
then&mdash;a hell-minded male full of sickness&mdash;not
good to view, even through the bars of a cage. But at
best to sit five hours, where he sat more than five days
and nights, would condemn the mind of any white man
or woman to chaos, or else restore it to the fine sanity of
Brotherhood.</p>

<p>And then the day when the breeze turned warm and
the Islands were green!... Coolies were men that
hour, men with eyes that melted to ineffable softness.
It was like Jesus coming toward them on the sea&mdash;the
green hills of Japan. Their hearts broke with emotion;
they wept and loved one another&mdash;this mass all molten
and integrated into one. It was like the Savior coming
to meet them through the warm bright air. He would
make them clean; their eyes would follow Him
always....</p>

<p>Morning was not the only one who had to be carried
ashore at Shimoneseki, after the quarantine officer had
finished with the herd. His passport saved him. “I
had to come. It was the first ship out of Tongu. Deck
passage was the only way they would take me,” was the
simple story. He was fevered, but strangely subdued
that day. Himmelhock was at the door of the pilot-house,
when Morning looked up from the shore a last
time, and his native sailors, bare to the thigh, were
sluicing the decks.</p>

<p>The bath was heaven. He was able to walk afterward.
The officials burned his clothing, but made it
possible for him to buy a few light things. The wound
in his leg was healing; the bruises fading away. The
wound in his side did not heal; it was angry as a feline
mouth.</p>

<p>He had bandages, but no stockings; clean canvas
clothing, but no underwear.... He found that he
had to wait before answering when anyone spoke; and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>then he was not quite sure if he had answered, and
would try again&mdash;until they stopped him. Somewhere
long ago there was a parrot whose eyes were rimmed&mdash;with
red-brown, and of stony opaqueness. He couldn’t
recall where the parrot was, but it had something to do
with him when he was little, almost beyond memory.
His eyes now felt just as the parrot’s had looked.</p>

<p>It was a night run back to Nagasaki by rail&mdash;his
thought was of ships, ships, ships. He could stand off
from the world and see the ships&mdash;all the lines of tossing,
steaming ships. Then he would go down to the deck of
one&mdash;and below and aft where Asiatics were crowded
together. To the darkest and thickest place among
them he would go, and there lie and rest until the finger
in his brain roused him. Then he would find that
the train had stopped. It was the halt that awakened
him.</p>

<p>There were two ships, all but ready to clear for the
States, lying in the harbor of Nagasaki that morning.
The first was the liner <i>Coptic</i>, but she had to go north
first, a day at Kobe, and two days at Yokohama, before
taking the long southeastern slide to Honolulu. She was
faster than the American transport, <i>Sickles</i> (with a light
load of sick and insane from the Islands), but the latter
was clearing for Honolulu at sundown and would reach
San Francisco at least one day earlier than the liner.
Moreover, the <i>Coptic</i> would have recent mails; the
<i>Sickles</i> would beat the mails.</p>

<p>Money was waiting for him at Tokyo, less than an
hour’s journey from Yokohama; he would have good
care and a comfortable passage home on the old liner,
but his brain burned at the thought. Four days north&mdash;not
homeward.... The <i>Sickles</i> was clipper-built&mdash;she
was white and clean-lined, lying out in the harbor,
in the midst of black collier babies. She was off for
Home to-night. He had traveled home once before on a
transport. He was American and she&mdash;the flag was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>there, run together a bit in the vivid light, but the flag
was there! And to-night he would be at sea&mdash;pulling
himself together for the big story, alone with the big
story&mdash;the ship never stopping&mdash;unless they stopped in
ocean to drop the dead....</p>

<p>The actual cost of the transport passage is very little,
merely a computation for food and berth; the difficulty
is to obtain the permit. As it was, he had not enough
money, barely enough to get up to Yokohama, second
class on the <i>Coptic</i>; and yet, this hardly entered. It was
like a home city, this American ship, to one who had
been in the alien heart of the Chinese country so long.
He would know someone, and a telegram from ’Frisco
would bring money to him. He had a mighty reliance
from the big story.</p>

<p>The U. S. quartermaster at Nagasaki was a tired old
man. He advised Morning to cable to Manila for permission.
Morning did not say that he lacked money
for this, but repeated his wish to go. The old man
thought a minute and then referred him to Ferry, the
<i>Sickles</i> quartermaster. He had been doing this for thirty
years, referring others to others so that all matters
merely struck and glanced from him. Thus he kept an
open mind. Morning wanted something to take from
this office to Ferry of the <i>Sickles</i>. The resistance he
encountered heated him. The smell of the deck-passage
was in his nostrils; it seemed in his veins, and made him
afraid that others caught the taint. The old quartermaster
did not help him. Morning could hear his own
voice, but could not hold in mind what he said....
The officer did not seem to be interested in Liaoyang.
This disturbed him. It made him ask if he had not
gone mad after all&mdash;if he could be wrong on this main
trend, that he had something the world wanted.</p>

<p>He took a <i>sampan</i> at the harbor-front and went
aboard the transport. Ferry, the <i>Sickles</i> quartermaster,
was a tall, lean man with a shut smile that drooped.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>The face was a pinched and diminished Mergenthaler,
and brought out the clouds and the manias of Morning’s
mind.</p>

<p>Were all quartermasters the same? What had become
of men? Had the world lost interest in monster heroisms?
Ferry did not help him&mdash;on the contrary, stood
looking down with the insolence of superior inches.
Morning found himself telling about the sorrel mare.
That would not do. He returned to the main fact that
he had the big story and must get across the Pacific
with it.</p>

<p>“I can’t take you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Morning heard it, but couldn’t believe. He tried to
tell about the <i>Hun huises</i> and the loss of the manuscript,
the walk to Koupangtse&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>“Really&mdash;it’s no affair of mine. I can’t take you on....
The <i>Coptic</i> is sailing&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>And just now Mr. Reever Kennard appeared on the
deck. The summer had added portliness. He was in
flannels&mdash;a spectacle for children and animals....
The insignificance of all about was quickened when Mr.
Reever Kennard appeared. The decks were less white,
sailors, soldiers more enlisted. John Morning became
an integer of the <i>Tungsheng’s</i> deck-passage again, and
the lining of his nostrils retained the reek of it.</p>

<p>“How do you do, Mr. Kennard?” he said. His back
was different. He felt a leniency there, very new or very
ancient, as he turned to Ferry, adding: “This gentleman
knows me. We parted in Tokyo this Spring, when I
went over with the Russians. I met him long ago in the
Philippine service. He will tell you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Ferry’s face grew suddenly saturnine, his eyes held in
the glance of the famous correspondent’s.</p>

<p>“You’ll please count it closed&mdash;I can’t take you.”</p>

<p>Morning now turned to Kennard, who was sealing
with his tongue a little flap of cigar-wrapper which may
have prevented the perfect draught. Morning bowed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>and moved aft, where the dust of the coaling was thick,
and the scores of natives, women and men, who handled
the baskets, were a distraction which kept the reality
from stifling him. Presently he went ashore and it was
noon.... He could not understand Kennard; could
not believe in an American doing what Ferry had done,
to a man who had the big story of Liaoyang. It was
some hideous mistake; he had not been able to make
himself understood.</p>

<p>The <i>Sickles</i> launch was leaving the pier at two.
Morning was there and took a seat. He was holding
himself&mdash;the avalanche again&mdash;and rehearsing in his
mind what he should say to Ferry. His brain was afire;
the wound in his side had scalded him so long that his
voice had a whimper in it. He had not eaten&mdash;the
thought was repulsive&mdash;but he had bought drink in the
thought of clearing his brain and deadening his
hurt....</p>

<p>His brain was clearer on the launch, but the gin
fumed out of him as he approached the upper deck,
where Ferry’s quarters were.</p>

<p>The Quartermaster saw him, but was speaking to an
infantry captain. Morning waited by the rail. Many
times he thought&mdash;if he could only begin to speak <i>now</i>.
Yet he feared in his heart when Ferry turned to him,
he would fail. It was something little and testy in the
man&mdash;something so different from what he had known in
the great strains of Liaoyang&mdash;except for Luban. Yes,
Ferry was like Luban, when Luban was in the presence
of a fancied inferior.... They talked on&mdash;Morning
thought of murder at last. A peculiar wiry strength
gathered about the idea of murder in its connection with
Ferry’s dark, mean face. He felt all the old strength
in his hands, and more from days of pain&mdash;days of holding
one’s self&mdash;will, body, brain.</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;&mdash;” Ferry had turned to him suddenly.</p>

<p>Morning’s thoughts winged away with a swarm of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>details of the crime.... “I could tell you something
of the Story&mdash;I could show you how they cut me
on the Liao&mdash;the <i>Hun huises</i>&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“If you come to this deck again&mdash;I’ll send you ashore
in irons.”</p>

<p>At four that afternoon Morning saw the <i>Coptic</i> draw
up her chains and slide out of the harbor, with the swift
ease of a river-ferry.... He could not count himself
whipped on the <i>Sickles</i>&mdash;and this is the real beginning
of John Morning. He was Fate-driven. The man
who did not have the courage to ask his rights in Tokyo&mdash;to
inquire the reason of his disbarment, was not
through with the American transport <i>Sickles</i>. A full
day ahead of the mails in San Francisco&mdash;and he was
waiting for the dusk. The fight had been brought to
him. He was dull to the idea of being whipped.</p>

<p>Three enlisted men were drinking in the little apothecary
shop which Morning had used for the day’s headquarters.
They belonged to the <i>Sickles</i>. They had been
taking just one more drink for many minutes. He told
them he was sailing on the transport and joined them
in a <i>sampan</i> to the ship when it was dark. The harbor
was still as a dream; the dark blending with the water....
They touched the bellying white plates of the
ship. Morning seemed to come up from infinite depths....
The men were very drunk; they had ordered
rapidly toward the end; the effect caught up as swiftly
now. They helped each other officiously. Morning put
on the fallen hat of one who had become unconscious....
The watch was of them, a corporal, who was no
trouble-maker. He blustered profusely and hurried
them below.... Morning was bewildered. He had
spoken no word, but helped the others carry the body, a
wobbly deputation, down among the hammocks....
He heard the voices of those maimed in mind....
He placed his end of the soldier’s body down, left his
companions, and made his way forward, to where the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>hammocks were farther apart. Early years had given
him a sort of enlisted man’s consciousness of things; and
he knew now not to take another’s place. He chose one
from a pile of hammocks and slung it forward, close to
the bulk-head of the bedlam, and well out of the lights....
He lay across his only baggage, a package containing
a thousand sheets of Chinese parchment. He
lay rigid, trying to remember if out-going ships took a
pilot out of Nagasaki.</p>

<p>He heard the anchor-chain. He was very close to it.
The voices of the sun-struck and vino-maddened men
from the Islands were deadened by the hideous grating
of the links in the socket.... It was not too late
for him to be put ashore even now; since it was war-time.
Of course there would be a pilot, for the harbor
was mined.... He drew the canvas about his ears,
but the voices of the brain-dead men reached him....
Cats, pirates, and river-reptiles terrified them;
one man was still lost in a jungle set with bolo-traps;
the emptiness of others was filled by strange abominations
glad of the flesh again.</p>

<p class="ph2">18</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">H</span>e</span> had been listening to Duke Fallows for a long
time&mdash;Duke’s voice blended with war and storm
and a woman’s laugh.... Then he reverted to the
idea of murdering Ferry. Finally someone said:</p>

<p>“He’s a new one from Nagasaki. He’s got the
fevers&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>And then:</p>

<p>“Who in hell is he?”</p>

<p>They began to ask questions. Morning answered
nothing. Day had come. He heard the throb of the
engines, felt the swell of the sea, but the strength of
yesterday’s concentration was still upon him. It had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>built a wall around him, holding the life of his mind
there; as a life of low desires imprisons the spirit to its
own vile region after death.... He did not speak,
but looked from face to face for Ferry.</p>

<p>They ceased to expect an answer from him....
A young doctor appeared. His eyes rolled queerly; his
cheek folded over his mouth, as if he were beyond
words from drink, and tremendously pleased with his
prowess. They called him Nevin. He prepared himself
profoundly for speech. Morning now realized the nimbleness
of Nevin’s hands, unwinding the filthy bandages.
Presently, the Doctor straightened up, passed
his hand over his brow, tongued the other cheek, and
after a sweating suspense ordered:</p>

<p>“Take him to the hospital.”</p>

<p>A white room.... The Doctor came again.
They took his clothing and bathed him.... He
heard and smelled the sea through an open port ...
glad, but utterly weary ... waiting for Ferry.</p>

<p>“My God&mdash;not only cut, but trampled&mdash;&mdash;” a voice
said.</p>

<p>Morning felt if he were alone with Nevin he could
have said something.... The Doctor looked like
a jockey he had once known. It wasn’t that, however,
that gave him heart, but the quick, gentle hands....
More and more as he watched the dusty face with its
ineffable gravity, he saw bright humanity burning like
a forge-fire behind the mask. This brought tears to his
own eyes. Nevin, seeing them, became altogether nervous
to look at, seemed to have a walnut in his mouth.</p>

<p>And now John Morning felt himself breaking&mdash;he
was brittle, hard like glass&mdash;and his last idea concerned
the package of Chinese parchment which they had not
brought from the hammock.... Six days afterward
he asked for it.</p>

<p>For a short while each day, during the interval, he
just touched the main idea and sank back to sleep. He
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>suffered very little. The after-effects of his journey
from Liaoyang tried to murder him in various ways, but
relaxation, nourishment, good air and care worked as a
sort of continuous anæsthesia. On this sixth day the
Doctor appeared to ignore his question about the package
of paper, but leaned forward, glanced to the right and
left, as if to communicate a plan to scuttle the ship, and
said:</p>

<p>“You’re one more little man. You’ve had a new one
each day&mdash;pneumonia, sclerosis, brain-fever....
My hospital report on your case will drive the Major-Surgeon
into permanent retirement.... What
did you say was the matter to-day&mdash;Chinese parchment?”</p>

<p>“I’ve got so much to do, Doctor?... What day
is this?”</p>

<p>“Morning of the nineteenth.”</p>

<p>The color swept into Morning’s face, terror into his
eyes.</p>

<p>“I didn’t think it was so bad as that&mdash;I can’t lay up
any more&mdash;twelve days left.... Two weeks and
two days since I rode out of Liaoyang&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I’ll have to let ’em put you in the forward hutch&mdash;if
you begin to talk Liaoyang, now that your fever’s
down. There wasn’t any Americans in that fighting&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I’m not a soldier&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Nevin wrung his hands. A thought recurred to
Morning.</p>

<p>“There was a couple of letters in my clothes&mdash;one
addressed to a paper in ’Frisco, and one to me.”</p>

<p>The other was curious enough to send an orderly to
search.</p>

<p>“Have him bring the package of paper, too,” Morning
said. When all was brought in good order, he added:
“This letter to me I’ll read later. The larger package is
Duke Fallows’ first hurried story of the battle of Liaoyang.
I won’t read that either, because I’ve got to do
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>one of my own. I did one, you know&mdash;ten times as long
as this&mdash;but the <i>Hun huises</i> got it on the Liao-crossing,
from Tawan&mdash;that’s where I got cut up. Morning of
the fourth, it was.... The sorrel mare did fifteen
miles with her guts sticking out, and I walked thirty to
Koupangtse, with these wounds and smashed from a
couple of falls&mdash;before the morning of the fifth....
You can look at Duke Fallows’ story, Doctor, and I’ll
take a little doze&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Fallows’ battle was done clearly as a football game,
and as briskly, to the withdrawal of the Russian lines
upon the inner positions of the city and the flanking
movement of Kuroki. A dramatic pause then to survey
the Russian force on the eve of disaster, from which
the reader drew the big moral sickness. After that
Lowenkampf, the millet and the Ploughman. In quite a
remarkable way Fallows turned the reader now from
the mass to the individual. In a little trampled place
in the grain the battle was lost by the Russians and won
by Japan.... The Doctor was interrupted several
times, but no force was missed. It was a new voice to
him. He wondered if Fallows would make the world
hear it. It seemed to compel a reckoning.</p>

<p>The Fallows story laughed all the way. One did not
have to look twice at a sentence to understand, yet two
readings did not wear it out, nor would it leave one
alone. All the time the Doctor read, matters he had
heard in delirium from the lips of John Morning came
back.</p>

<p>Nevin remembered the tears on the first morning,
the choke in his own throat; the first sight of the wounds,
the queer, extra zeal he had put into this case. Finally
he could hardly wait to learn the rest&mdash;chiefly how John
Morning had happened to be lying in the darkest end
of the hammock-hole, over against the insane compartment....
Yet he did not wake up his patient.
When Morning finally opened his eyes, it was time for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>nourishment. Nevin brought a glass of extra wine before
inquiring. “First, tell me&mdash;has Ferry seen me?”</p>

<p>“Captain Ferry, the quartermaster?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I’d rather think not. He’s about occasionally&mdash;but
his truck with the sick men is mostly transportation and
nourishment&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“The second time I came to ask him to take me
across that afternoon&mdash;the second time,” Morning said
slowly, “he told me that if I appeared on his deck again
he’d send me ashore in irons. You see the <i>Sickles</i> is to
beat the <i>Coptic</i> in. I had to come. Why, the mails
couldn’t beat me through from Liaoyang.... I
finally got aboard with some soldiers&mdash;but I would have
leeched to the anchor.... And, say, I think I
knew you that morning. It seemed as if I could let go
when I felt your hands&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The two were quiet. The Doctor looked obliquely at
an open port with one eye shut, as if he were not sure of
the count....</p>

<p>Accompanying the manuscript was a letter to Noyes,
editor of <i>Western States</i>, which chiefly concerned John
Morning. Many brave things were said....
Nevin, deeply stirred with the whole business, saw the
Ploughman coming forth from the millet&mdash;saw the
Ploughman going home. That little drama so dear to
Fallows’ heart <i>was</i> greater than Liaoyang. Nevin saw
that such things are deathless.... Deathless&mdash;that’s
the word. They look little at the time in the midst
of thunder and carnage; but the thunder dies away and
the rains come and clean the stains&mdash;and the spirit of it
all lives in one deed or in one sentence. A woman nurses
the sick at Scutari, and the Crimean war is known for
the angel of its battlefield, by the many who do not know
who fought, nor what for.... Nevin felt the big
forces throbbing in the world&mdash;the work of the world.
It had come to him distantly before. It had pulled him
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>out of the comfort and ease of his home town to serve
the sick at sea and in the Islands.</p>

<p>The mystery of service. He had never dared tell
anyone. His voice broke so easily. He had covered
the weakness in leers and impediments, so the world
would not see. He had talked of his rights and his
wages, the dusty-faced little man. Mystery of Service&mdash;and
men were ashamed when it touched them.</p>

<p>But Fallows, laughing and so powerful, this boy’s
man-friend, wasn’t afraid. Was the boy afraid? What
had driven him? Did the boy know what had driven
him? What, in God’s name, had driven this human
engine that would not stop&mdash;that threw off poisons and
readjusted itself against the individual and collective
organizations of death?</p>

<p>Nevin was shaken by the whole story&mdash;it girded,
girdled him.... Let Ferry come. Ferry was one
of those bleak despoilers of human effort, whose presence
consumed the reality in another. What was Ferry
anyway and Ferry’s sort&mdash;a spoiled child or an ancient
decadent principle? Was it merely a child-soul with a
universe ahead, or was he very old and very ill&mdash;incorrigible
self-love on its road back to nothing?...
But the Ploughman lived, Fallows lived, the boy Morning
lived&mdash;their work was marching on.</p>

<p>The Doctor did not speak, because his voice would
break. He went about his work instead&mdash;swift magnetic
hands.... At least, he could stand between
Morning and the quartermaster&mdash;if there were need.</p>

<p>When he came back Morning was at work, a hard
bright look of tension about him, and a line of white
under the strange young beard....</p>

<p>“I think I can get it going now. I think it is beginning
to come again,” he said in a hushed tone. The
Doctor arranged the pillows better, sharpened an extra
pencil and went out.</p>

<p>“I may have to do those first pages again,” he said
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>an hour later. “It’s hard to get out of the hospital&mdash;you
know, what I mean&mdash;a man’s bath is so important
to one lying-up that it shuts out a battle-line. What a
fool a sick man is. But I’ll get it&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He fell asleep in the dusk before the candles came.
The Doctor found him cool, his breathing normal....
The next day Morning worked until Nevin remonstrated.</p>

<p>“You’ll die, if you go on&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I’ll die, if I don’t,” said Morning. The Doctor
knew in his heart that it was true. Still they compromised.
That night, as Morning dropped down into
an abyss of exhaustion, he mumbled the whole story of
Eve&mdash;the sorrel mare. “She rose to her feet&mdash;white
death in her eyes,” he finished....</p>

<p>Nothing attracts the eye on ship-board like a man
at work. All idle ones are caught in the current and
come to pay their devoirs to the man mastered by a
strong task.... The Doctor had Morning taken
to an extra berth in his own state-room. The door had
a spring lock, for many medicines and stores were there.
Ferry was not likely to happen in the Doctor’s quarters.
The latter even doubted if he would recognize Morning.
He came and went, as the task drove on. Once Morning
stopped to tell him about the deck passage on the
<i>Tungsheng</i>, and another time about his brush with the
<i>Hun huises</i> in the ravine across the river from Tawan....
The Doctor saw that Morning had made a wonderful
instrument of himself; he studied how the passion
of an artist works on the body of man. The other
found that so long as he ate regularly and fell asleep
without a struggle&mdash;he was allowed to go on.</p>

<p>The <i>Sickles</i> was swinging down into the warmth.
The sick man had a bad day, lying in the harbor at
Honolulu.</p>

<p>“It isn’t the work, Doctor&mdash;it’s the ship’s stopping,”
Morning said, squirming in the berth. “It makes my
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>head hot. I see steamy and all that. I had it when the
<i>Tungsheng</i> lay up for a day in Chifu on account of the
blow.... I had it that day in Nagasski when Ferry
wouldn’t take me on. I’ll be all right to-night....
Give me a little touch of that gin and lime juice&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Just lime juice when heads get hot.... You’re
a clever little drunkard. I’ve been wondering how far
you’d go.... Yes, we’ll clear to-night....
Ferry’s ashore. Come out and see the black boys dive
for pennies.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“There’s something doing with this knife-wound&mdash;it
doesn’t heal,” the Doctor said, mid-way between the Islands
and the Farallonnes. “The leg’s all right. Organs
and all the little organs seem to thrive on work. That
is, they’re no worse. The leg heals&mdash;but this one&mdash;you
seem to have established a permanent drain&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Fifty pages yesterday&mdash;two hundred words a page,”
Morning muttered.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;and the day before&mdash;and to-morrow&mdash;and the
night we left Honolulu.... If a man worked that
way for money, he’d be as dead as Ferry inside of a
month.... Have you read your friend Fallows’
story yet?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t dare&mdash;a sick man isn’t all himself. And
<i>this</i> story is me. It’s got to be me. It’s better in places
than the other, the one I lost.... I haven’t read
Duke’s letter to me yet. He’s strong medicine. He keeps
coming back to me, as it is. I want to get off alone when
the work is done and think. You can’t see him all, when
he’s in a room with you.... He was like you, in
being a friend to me.... Yet, I seem to know you
better. You’ve helped me so. I’m pretty happy the way
the story is coming&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“See how long you can go without a drink to-day.”</p>

<p>“It starts me off, you see. It doesn’t seem to touch
me&mdash;just steams right off with the work&mdash;&mdash;”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span></p>
<p>“That’s rotten sophistry. I’m watching you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Nevin had never seen a body so driven by will.
Morning appeared no worse; certainly he was no better;
his brain was in absolute abeyance; his will crashed
through clouds of enervation and irresolution. There
were times when Nevin believed Morning would collapse,
when he was finished with Liaoyang, but he was
not so sure now. He was sure, however, that he must
not interfere except in extremity.... This was
part of the big work. Somehow he trusted in Duke
Fallows&mdash;who had allowed the boy to write the detailed
battle-end, and gone back to Europe to feed the
babes of the Ploughman. That last made him want to
doctor the whole world....</p>

<p>Morning had done the story and re-written the lead.
The <i>Sickles</i> would enter the Gate at daylight.</p>

<p>“There’s seventy-five or eighty thousand words of it.
It’s good&mdash;unless I’m crazy. It’s good, unless this is
all a dream. God, I’m thirsty.”</p>

<p>With the work done for the day, however, he asked
for lime juice and water. His temperature was less
than two points above normal; nothing had broken; yet
the voyage had not replenished Morning’s body. He
could hardly stand.</p>

<p>“To-night I’ll read the Fallows’ stuff&mdash;and the
letters.... Doctor, can you get me ashore
early?”</p>

<p>“Think a minute&mdash;you don’t know what you ask&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Quarantine&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Nevin nodded. “There’s extra attention to a ship like
this&mdash;they’ll have to see that running wound of yours
for instance&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Not if you don’t report it&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The Doctor’s lower jaw reached down, and to the
right, finding the walnut. “You wouldn’t even read
Duke Fallows’ story before you wrote yours. A man
can’t lie in his own work&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span></p>

<p>“You’ve been so good,” Morning said huskily. “I
begin to expect miracles&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You can get messages&mdash;telegrams, letters&mdash;ashore....
And then it may only take a couple of hours.
There isn’t any contagion here that I know of.”</p>

<p>Morning first read Fallows’ letter to Noyes, editor
<i>Western States</i>. It told of the story accompanying&mdash;but
more of the bearer. Laughing, loving-hearted, eloquent&mdash;Fallows
was all through it, and fine gifts of the man’s
thinking. There was suggestion to Noyes to use Morning’s
story and get it across simultaneously in New York.
“The boy has never yet, so far as I can see, found time
to arrange a decent payment for his work. Please observe
that unless some one, equally as capable, gets into
Port Arthur, Morning’s story will be the biggest feature
of the war in a newspaper way. I’m going on to Europe
on the Ploughman story. Let Morning do the big battle&mdash;I’ll
begin to crackle later.”</p>

<p>And then Morning read the story.... His
voice trailed up finally from the shadows of lower
berth. “It’s good,” he said to the Doctor after midnight.</p>

<p>“It’s dam’ good. It’s better than mine.... He
was alive with it&mdash;I mean with the <i>Ploughman</i>. It’s the
way he did it. He tried to get it across before we separated.
He told me from every angle&mdash;told Lowenkampf&mdash;told
them all at the station at Yentai. None of us
could see.... He was crazed about it&mdash;that we
couldn’t see. We were all choked with blood and death
that night. He said Kuropatkin and the others would
see that the Ploughman was right&mdash;if they had a sense
of humor. Such density to humor, he called the sin
against the Holy Ghost&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>After they had talked many minutes, Morning
broke the seal to his own letter and learned why
he had been barred from the earlier Japanese
armies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span></p>

<p class="ph2">19</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> fineness of Fallows, of Nevin, of Endicott, the
station-agent at Tongu, the risen humanity of the
Ploughman&mdash;Morning’s soul to sense these men was
empty within him. All that he knew was blood and
blow and force and mass and hate. He lay panting and
possessed. As he had plotted in delirium how to kill
Ferry, dwelling upon the process and the death; so
Reever Kennard came in now for a hatred as perfect and
destructive. The letter had called up something of the
same force which had driven John Morning from Liaoyang,
over or through every barrier to the present hour
in which the <i>Sickles</i> lay off the entrance of the Golden
Gate waiting for dawn, thirty-six hours ahead of the
<i>Coptic</i>.</p>

<p>His work was diminished in his own mind; the value
of his story was lost, the zest to market it, the sense of
the world’s waiting. He was a thief in the eyes of men.
A man cannot steal. They believed him a thief....
He thought of moving about the halls of the <i>Imperial</i>
that day&mdash;of his thoughts as he had watched from the
window in the billiard-room while the picture was taken.
He had been tranced in terror.... Had he but
known, he would have made a hell in that house. He
saw Reever Kennard again on the deck of the <i>Sickles</i>&mdash;his
turning to Kennard for help&mdash;unparalleled shame....
The thing he desired with such terrible zeal
now was enacted in his brain. That hour on the deck
of the <i>Sickles</i> was repeated, but this time he knew what
Kennard had done. He called him to the lie in imagination.
The jowl was heavy with scorn and the small
slow eyes were bright with fear&mdash;yet they took nothing
back and Morning moved closer and closer demanding,
until the devil broke from him, and his knotted hand
sank into the soft center of the man. He watched the
writhing of that clean flanneled liar, watched him arise.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>The hand sank once more ... the vile play romping
through his mind again and again&mdash;hideous fighting
of a man brought up among stable and race-track and
freight-route ruffians&mdash;the fighting that feels no pain
and only a knockout can stop....</p>

<p>“Wow&mdash;it’s hot as hell in here,” came from Nevin in
the upper bunk.</p>

<p>A little before dawn, utterly ravaged by the poison
of his thinking, Morning was struck by the big idea. He
turned on the light, steadied himself to paper and pencil
and wrote to Noyes of the <i>Western States</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Inclosed find (I) Duke Fallows’ first story of
Liaoyang; (II) his letter to you, containing among
other things information concerning the bearer;
(III) the first ten thousand words of my eighty-thousand-word
story of the battle fought a month
ago to an hour&mdash;including sketches of Kuropatkin,
and others, covering exactly terrain, the entire position,
strategy, and finally the cause of the Russian
disaster, with word-picture of the retreat, done on
the day when it was at its height. The writer left
the field and made the journey to Koupangtse alone,
nearly one hundred miles to the railroad. This is the
only American eye-witness story besides Fallows’.
The mails of the second-hand reports will not reach
here before the arrival of the <i>Coptic</i>.... I will
sell this story to the <i>Western States</i> on condition that
it appear in the <i>World-News</i>, New York, simultaneously&mdash;the
story to be run in not less than seven
installments, beginning by telegraph to-morrow. I
insist on the <i>World-News</i>, but have no objection to
the general syndicating of the story by the <i>Western
States</i>, my price for the American newspaper rights
being $1,800 and transportation to New York.</p>
</div>

<p>“In God’s name, are you doing another book?”
Nevin demanded, letting himself down from the berth.
“What’s the matter&mdash;you’re on fire?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span></p>
<p>Morning was counting off the large first installment
of his manuscript. He placed it upon the table, with the
Fallows’ story and the two letters to Noyes....
Then he put an empty water-pitcher on it, restoring the
balance of his story to its place under his pillow.</p>

<p>“Listen” he said, clutching Nevin’s arm, “here’s the
whole thing&mdash;if I’m sick to-morrow. Give it to the reporter
from the <i>Western States</i>&mdash;make him see it is life-blood.
Make him rush with it to Noyes. It’s the whole
business.... He’ll get it&mdash;before the quarantine
is lifted, if you&mdash;oh, if you can! It’s all there....
You do this for me?”</p>

<p>“And where will you be all this time&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, Nevin&mdash;Nevin&mdash;for God’s sake put me to sleep!
I’m full of burning and devils! Fill up that needle
business and put me to sleep!... I can’t wait to
get across in the New York <i>World-News</i>. That’s Reever
Kennard’s own paper.”</p>

<p class="ph2">20</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> voices sounded far and muted&mdash;voices one
might hear when swimming under water. It was
easier for him to stay down than rise and answer. He
seemed carried in the strong flow of a river, and preserved
a consciousness, very vague, that it meant death
to go down with the stream. At last, opening his eyes,
he saw the city over the pier-sheds.</p>

<p>The rest of the manuscript was still under the pillow,
but the water-pitcher rested upon the bare wood of
the table. It was after twelve. His deadly fury had
burned itself out. The thought of the <i>World-News</i> taking
the story, steadied his weakness. It was much
harder to dress than usual, however. He had no shore
clothes, but Nevin would see to that for him. With a
glad thrill, he realized that the <i>Sickles</i> had passed the
quarantine, or she wouldn’t be in the slip. His mind
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>turned to Nevin again, and when he was thinking about
this deep-rooted habit the voyage had inculcated, the
Doctor himself entered.</p>

<p>“Well, you gave me a night.”</p>

<p>“You’ll have some rest now.”</p>

<p>“I’ve brought some clothes for you to go ashore
with.... The <i>Western States</i> got your story two
hours ago. Ferry has gone ashore.”</p>

<p>“Did the reporter take it here&mdash;or from across the
harbor in quarantine?”</p>

<p>“He was waiting with others&mdash;for us to be turned
loose. I gave him the stuff as we were putting about.
He didn’t come aboard, I saw his launch reach landing.
I told him to put the stuff into the hands of Noyes and
to hurry back. All of which he did&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Why to hurry back?”</p>

<p>The little man’s mouth gave way to strange twistings,
and he answered grudgingly, “Well, I had a story
to give him.”</p>

<p>Morning took a room at the Armory, refusing a loan
from the Doctor. “I’ll have it shortly&mdash;plenty, I think.
I’ll lie up there until I hear from Noyes. I may hurry
East&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The process was not clear exactly, but the old story
of <i>Mio Amigo</i> had given him a terror of borrowing.
The Armory was nearby. It was clean and cheap. This
little decision of choosing the Armory, a result of <i>Mio
Amigo</i>, too, is the most important so far.... The
Doctor went with him. The two were hushed and sick
with things to say. Nevin felt he was losing the throb
of great service; that he could not hold it all after this
power-house of a man went his way. It was not only
Morning, but Morning was attached to the large, quiet
doings and seeings of the stranger named Duke Fallows.</p>

<p>Morning loved the Doctor. Nevin did not tower;
Nevin was instantly in his comprehension. Their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>throats tightened.... Nevin saw him to the light
little room, and said as he was leaving:</p>

<p>“I’ve been all over Chinatown, looking up a formula
for that wound that won’t heal. It’s this&mdash;full directions
inclosed. You’ll have to get settled before you try
it out.”</p>

<p>He disappeared saying he would be back. Morning
put the envelope in a wallet, which he had carried afield....
It was not yet two in the afternoon. There
was a timorous rap at the door. Morning’s head dropped
over drowsily. The door opened just a little and a voice
said:</p>

<p>“Is there a sick American soldier in here?”</p>

<p>It was low and timorous like the tapping, but there
was a laugh in it, and something that drove the wildness
out of his heart.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said.</p>

<p>“And may I come in?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>She was slight and young and pale. She passed between
the window and his eyes. Her brown hair seemed
half-transparent. The day was bright, but not yellow;
its soft gray luster was exactly the woman’s tone. There
was a curious unreality about the whole figure. The
light in her eyes was like the light in the window; gray
eyes and very deep. So quietly, she came, and the day
was quiet, the house&mdash;a queer hush everywhere.</p>

<p>“There are a few of us who meet the transports&mdash;and
call on the sick soldiers. We talk to them&mdash;write
letters or telegrams. Sometimes they are very glad. All
we want is to help. I haven’t tried many times
before&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Someone had told him once of a woman in London,
who met the human drift in from the far tides of chance&mdash;and
made their passing or their healing dear as heaven.
He had always kept the picture. He scarcely heard all
that this young woman was saying.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span></p>

<p>She was not beautiful, not even pretty. You would
see her last in a room full of women. Under her eyes&mdash;he
could not tell just where&mdash;there was a line or shadow
of strange charm; and where the corner of her eye-lids
folded into the temple a delicate perfection lived; her
frail back had a line of beauty&mdash;again, he could not
describe this. The straightness of the figure was that of
lightness, of aspiration.... Sometimes she seemed
just a girl. Her underlip pursed a little; it was not red....
She seemed waiting with the lightness of a
thistle&mdash;waiting and listening in the lull before a wind.</p>

<p>“My name is Betty Berry.”</p>

<p>“Mine is John Morning.”</p>

<p>She told him that she was a musician, and that San
Francisco was her home, although she was much away.
He saw her with something that Duke Fallows had
given him. The hush deepened with the thought. Had
he taken from that tired breast a certain age and clear-eyedness
and judgment of the ways of love-women?
There might have been reality in this; certainly there
was reality in his not having seen a white girl in many
months. He was changed; his work done for the moment;
he was very tired and hungry for something she
brought.... “Betty Berry.”</p>

<p>He <i>was</i> changed. This Western world was new to
him. He seemed old to the East&mdash;old, much-traveled,
and very weary; here was faith and tenderness and reality.
Duke Fallows’ city&mdash;Duke had strangely intrenched
himself here; and this wraith of an angel who came to
him ministering!... Malice and ambition&mdash;reprisal
and murder were gone. What a dirty little man he
had been&mdash;how rotten with self, how furious and unspeakable.
Why had he not seen it? Why had he rejected
Duke Fallows with his brain and accepted him
with his soul? The soul&mdash;what queer place in a man
is this? Duke Fallows, Lowenkampf&mdash;were in and out,
and Nevin, even the Ploughman now; and this little gray
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>hushed spirit of a girl had come straight to his soul.
Why could one not always feel these Presences? Would
such destroying and malignant hatred return as that for
Reever Kennard last night? Was it because he had been
so passionate for self&mdash;that until now, (when he was
resting and she came), decency, delight, nor vision had
been able to break through the deadly self-turned currents?...
This was like his finer self coming into
the room.</p>

<p>“How did you know that boys coming home&mdash;need
to see you?” he asked. He had to be very careful and
arrange what he meant to say briskly and short. Most
of his thoughts would not do at all to speak.</p>

<p>“Women know. So many boys come home&mdash;like
those on the <i>Sickles</i> whom one is not allowed to see. I
have watched them going out, too. They don’t know why
they go. They don’t expect to find a new country, and
yet it seems as if they must go and look. And many
come home so numbed with loneliness that they have forgotten
what they need.”</p>

<p>“Then women know what boys&mdash;men are?”</p>

<p>She smiled, and seemed listening&mdash;her lips pursed,
her eyes like a cloudy dawn, turned from him slightly.
What did she hear continually that did not come to
him?</p>

<p>“I mean the men,” he added, “whom the world calls
its bravest&mdash;the gaunt explorers and fighters&mdash;do women
know what boys they are?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know those whom the world calls its
bravest.”</p>

<p>“I think I needed to have you come,” he said, “but
I didn’t know it.”</p>

<p>The hush was in the room again. Morning felt like
a little boy&mdash;and as if she were a child with braids behind.
They felt wonderful things, but could only talk
sillinesses.... There was something different about
her every time he looked. It seemed if she were gone;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>he could not summon her face to mind. He did not
understand it then.</p>

<p>It had grown quite a little darker before they noticed.
The far rumble of thunder finally made them see
a storm gathering.</p>

<p>“You won’t go until it’s over?”</p>

<p>“It might be better for me to go now&mdash;before it
begins.”</p>

<p>“Do you live far?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then stay&mdash;please.”</p>

<p>She drew her chair closer. They tried to tell each
other of what they had been, but this didn’t prosper.
The peculiar thing was that their history seemed to begin
from now&mdash;all was far and unimportant but this.
Morning, moreover, did not mean to spoil the primary
idea in her mind of his being an American soldier;
though all his recent history impinged upon the one fact
that he wasn’t.... He tried to hold her face in his
mind with shut eyes, but it was a forced and unfair picture
when mentally dragged there.... The thunder
increased and the rain.</p>

<p>“Once when I was little,” she said, “I was alone in
the house when a storm came, and I was so frightened
that day&mdash;that I never could be since, in just the same
way.”</p>

<p>Perfect revelation. Something in him wished she
were pretty. She was such a shy and shadowy creature.
He called to mind the girls he had known&mdash;coarse and
tawdry lot, poor things. Betty Berry was all that they
were not; yet some of them were prettier. He could see
their faces quite distinctly, and this startled him, because
shutting his eyes from full gaze at this girl, he
could not see her twice the same.... The weather
cleared. They were together in silence for moments at
a time. She became more and more like a wraith when
the natural dusk thickened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span></p>

<p>“Was it hard for you to knock and speak&mdash;that first
moment?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Do&mdash;do any of the soldiers ever misunderstand?”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That’s fine of them,” he granted.</p>

<p>“They couldn’t when one has no thought, only to be
kind to them&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You think they see that at once?”</p>

<p>“They must.”</p>

<p>“A man doesn’t know all about soldiers simply because
he ‘soldiers’ with them,” Morning said.</p>

<p>“And then&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“They look at me and it’s very plain that I come just
to be good to them.... They think of me in the
same way as a Salvation Army lassie or a missionary&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Now, that’s queer,” said he. “It didn’t occur to me
at all. It would never come to me to ask you to leave
a tract.”</p>

<p>“And I didn’t feel like a missionary, either....
Now it’s all cleared again. I must go.”</p>

<p>There was a pang.... Where was Nevin?
Why had Noyes or someone from the <i>Western States</i>
not come to him? Coming back to these things pained....
A boy in the halls called the afternoon papers
in a modified voice.</p>

<p>“Will you get me the papers&mdash;especially the <i>Western
States</i>?”</p>

<p>She hurried to call the boy. He saw the huge picture
of Duke Fallows on the sheet toward him, as she re-entered.</p>

<p>“This is what I want,” he said hoarsely, taking the
<i>Western States</i>....</p>

<p>“John Morning,” she whispered.</p>

<p>In inch letters across the top&mdash;there it was:</p>

Morning’s riding forth from Liaoyang on the night of
the third&mdash;the sorrel mare&mdash;the Hun Crossing&mdash;the Liao
Crossing and the fight with the river-bandits&mdash;the runaway
of the sorrel and her broken heart&mdash;his journey
dazed and delirious, covered with wounds, thirty miles to
Koupangtse&mdash;Tongu&mdash;the battle to get aboard the
<i>Sickles</i>, first, second, and third attempts&mdash;redoing the
great story on shipboard&mdash;all this in form of an interview
and printed as a local story, ran ahead of the Duke
Fallows article.</p>

<p>A great moment, and John Morning, forgetting all
else, even forgetting the girl who glanced at him with
awed and troubled eyes, held hard for a moment to the
one realization: Noyes would not have printed, “Begins
in the <i>Western States</i> to-morrow,” had he not arranged
for publication in Reever Kennard’s <i>World-News</i>....</p>

<p>Her chair was farther away. She waited for him&mdash;as
one expecting to be called. He turned; their eyes
met full.</p>

<p>“You are not an American soldier&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span></p>

<p>“I am an American. I have had a hard time, almost
as hard as any soldier could&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t have come&mdash;the whole city will serve
you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That’s why I didn’t speak. No soldier could have
gotten more good.”</p>

<p>Her eyes turned downward. The room was almost
dark. A knock at the door.</p>

<p>“I must go&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He held out his hand. “Won’t you come again?”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t seem&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He would not let her hand go. “Oh, won’t you come
again?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Thank you.”</p>

<p>Betty Berry opened the door for Noyes and another,
and she passed out.</p>

<p class="ph2">21</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">N</span>oyes</span> said lightly:</p>

<p>“The young lady doesn’t need to go on our
account&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But she’s gone,” Morning muttered. The walls gave
him back the words.</p>

<p>“If it’s any interest to you, Morning, I’ve followed
directions in your letter,” the editor said presently.</p>

<p>“The <i>World-News</i>&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That’s what I waited for&mdash;before coming here.
They’re using Field’s local story to-morrow morning.
It’s on the wire to them now. This is Field.”</p>

<p>“I had the pleasure of bringing in your manuscript
from the <i>Sickles</i> rather early this morning,” said the latter.
“Also I did the story that Doctor Nevin told me.”</p>

<p>“I wish he would come,” said Morning.</p>

<p>“Nevin?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span></p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“He’s on his toes where you are concerned,” said
Field.</p>

<p>“He has done much for me&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Friend Fallows is rather strong for you, too, I
should say,” Noyes offered.</p>

<p>He was a pale, soft, middle-aged man who gave the
impression of being more forceful than he looked.</p>

<p>“I owe everything to him,” said Morning.</p>

<p>“By the way, Morning, what were you mad at, when
you wrote that letter of directions to me? I followed
it carefully as you said&mdash;price&mdash;<i>World-News</i>&mdash;everything.
We’ll have a lot of other papers beside the
<i>World-News</i>&mdash;but that letter made me hot under the
collar every time I glanced at it&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I was just about to break. I was very sick of
words. Every sentence was like drawing a rusty chain
in one ear and out the other.”</p>

<p>“Of course you know you’ve got the world by the
tail on this Russian end&mdash;this Liaoyang story,” Noyes
observed.</p>

<p>“I’ve written the story. The big part of the copy
is here for you.”</p>

<p>“You’re not going to quit now. Are you down and
out physically?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Why, Morning,” Field broke in, “you ought to make
ten thousand dollars in the next thirty days. You’ve
got a big feature for every magazine in America&mdash;and
then the book.”</p>

<p>“The chance doesn’t come but once in a life time&mdash;and
then only to God’s chosen few, who work like hell,”
said Noyes, and he sat back to review this particularly
finished remark.</p>

<p>“What would you do?” Morning asked.</p>

<p>“I’d start for New York to-night. Field’s story about
you&mdash;the one we run to-night at the head of Fallows’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>story&mdash;will start the game. A couple of installments of
your big yarn will have appeared in the <i>World-News</i>
when you reach New York. If it ends as good as it begins,
you’ll have the big town groggy within a week.
You’ll receive the magazine editors in your hotel, contract
to furnish so much&mdash;and talk off same to expert
typists. That’s the way things are done. You’ve got
the goods. New York serves a man like that. It’s
nothing to me, but I know the game&mdash;even if I never
cornered a Liaoyang story. Fallows said you have done
more work for less money than any man in America.
He’s one of our owners&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>So Noyes rambled on; Field breaking in with fresh
and timely zest. Morning had not looked beyond the
main story. He saw separate articles now in every
phase. It would work out.... Four days of rest&mdash;looking
out of the car-window. He would land in
New York once and for all&mdash;land hard&mdash;do it all at
once. Then he would rest.... He was seething
again.... With this advantage he could break into
the markets that would stand aloof from his ordinary
product for years. All day his devil had slept, and now
was awake for rough play in the dusk. His dreams
organized&mdash;the big markets&mdash;breaking out of the newspapers
into the famous publications! He had the stuff.
It would be as Noyes said. He would have thought of
it for another man.</p>

<p>“How soon can I start?” he said.</p>

<p>“Four or five hours.”</p>

<p>“I’m obliged to you.... Fallows seems still
with me,” he said strangely.... “I must see
Nevin&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>There was a ringing in his brain at some unused
door, but he did not answer. He was driven again.
Harrowing the idea of waiting a single day ... in
these modern hours when world-events are so swiftly
forgotten.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span></p>

<p>Everything was settled. Morning was taken from
place to place in a cab. Noyes not only was conscientious
about seeing to every detail for Friend Fallows&mdash;but
he made it very clear that he was not accustomed to
spend his evenings down-town. From time to time, he
dropped hints of what he would be doing at home at
this hour. Down-town nights were all put away for
him, he declared.</p>

<p>The balance of the manuscript was locked in the safe
at the <i>Western States</i> to be set up to-morrow, and proofs
sent out. The second and possibly third installments of
the story would go to the <i>World-News</i> by telegraph,
the rest follow by mail.</p>

<p>“To-morrow morning, out in the mountains, you’ll
have the satisfaction of knowing that New York is reading
Field’s story which we ran to-day. Is that stuff the
Doctor gave us, right, Morning?”</p>

<p>“Huh?”</p>

<p>“Did you dream about that sorrel mare&mdash;entrails
out&mdash;walking like a man&mdash;white death in her eyes?”
Noyes pursued.</p>

<p>“God, I wonder if I did? Did I dream that I did the
big story twice?&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He was in pain; there was lameness in his mind at
being driven again. He wished Noyes would go home....
Messengers were back and forth to the <i>Sickles</i>
trying to get Nevin. Transportation to New York was
the newspaper’s affair; when it was handed him, something
went from Morning that he could not get again.
There was much to drink. Noyes had put all this from
him so long that he found the novelty humorous&mdash;and
yet, what a bore it was after all! Field was a steaming
geyser of enthusiasms. Both talked. Others talked.
Morning was sick with words. He had not had words
drummed into his brain in so long. He half-realized
that his impatience for all these things was disgust at
himself, but all his past years, and their one-pointed aim
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>held him now. This was his great chance.... He
wanted Nevin.</p>

<p>These city men gave him everything, and disappointed
him. Had he been forced to battle with them for
markets; had he been forced to accept the simple column
rate, he could not have seen them as now. Because they
had become his servants, he touched their weakness.
And what giants he had known&mdash;Fallows and Nevin&mdash;and
Endicott, the little Englishman at Tongu....
You must answer a man’s need when that need is desperate&mdash;to
make a heart-hold. A man makes his friends
before his world capitulates.</p>

<p>He was waiting in the bar of the <i>Polander</i>....
Nevin had not been found. Morning was clothed, expensed;
his order upon New York for the price of the
story would not be touched until he reached there. He
had won already; he had the world by the tail....
Nevin did not come. There was no bite in the drink for
Morning. He was in pain; others made a night of it.
He struggled in the pits of self, that sleepless, never-forgetting
self. There was a calling, a calling deep
within, but the outer noise spoiled the meaning. Men
drank with single aim; they drank like Russian officers&mdash;to
get drunk. They were drunk; all was rich and free.
Noyes knew many whom he saw every day, and many
whom he had seen long ago. He called them forward to
meet Morning, who had brought in the story....
Morning who knew Duke Fallows&mdash;Morning who had
the big story of the year, beginning to-morrow....
And always when they passed, Noyes remarked that the
down-town stuff was silly as the devil. White and clerical,
his oaths were effective. He drank hard and well
as men go. Field drank well&mdash;his impulses becoming
more gusty, but not evil.... Once Morning would
have called this a night of triumph. Every one looked
at him&mdash;talked respectfully&mdash;whispered, pointed....
Twenty minutes left&mdash;the crowd grew denser in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span><i>Polander</i> bar. There was a voice in the arch to the
hotel. Ferry entered in the midst of men. He was talking
high, his eyes dancing madly.</p>

<p>“Why, the son of ... threw me&mdash;that’s all.
He’s done with the <i>Sickles</i>.... Who? Why,
Nevin, the squint-eyed son of a.... He threw me....
I thought this Morning was some drunken remittance
man wanting passage. Reever Kennard said
he was a thief.... Nevin might have come to me....
Why, Morning didn’t even pay his commutation
for rations&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I would have mailed it to you, Ferry&mdash;except for
this meeting,” said Morning, his voice raised a little to
carry.</p>

<p>An important moment to him, and one of the strangest
of his life. This was the man whom he had dreamed
of murdering, the man who had made him suffer as
only the gods should make men suffer. And yet Ferry
was like an unpleasant child; and Morning, troubled by
greater things, had no hate now, no time nor inclination
to hate. The face that had seemed dark and pitiless
on the deck in Nagasaki harbor&mdash;was only weak
and undone&mdash;an unpleasant child crying, refusing to be
quieted&mdash;an annoyance to the house. Such was the
devil of the <i>Sickles</i>, the man who had stood between him
and America, the man who had tried to make him miss
beating the <i>Coptic</i> mails.... They faced each
other, the quartermaster, wincing and shrunken.</p>

<p>“I had to get across, Ferry. I was too sick to make
you see. Kennard always says that. He seems to know
that best&mdash;but it isn’t true.... I was bad to look
at. You see, I had come a long way. I was off my
head and eyes&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know,” Ferry blurted, “and now Nevin has
thrown me. I wasn’t supposed to take civilians&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I know it&mdash;only I had to get across.... I
don’t know what I’d have done but for Nevin. He was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>mother and father on the voyage. I can give you the
commutation now&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You were a stowaway&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That’s what made it delicate to pay for the
passage&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Ferry was broken-nerved. He suggested buying a
drink, as a child who has learned a fancied trick of
men.</p>

<p>And Morning drank. Noyes glanced at Field, who
had suddenly become pale and anxious with a story-idea.
He was at work&mdash;drink-clouds shoved back and all
the exterior enthusiasm&mdash;fresh as after a night’s rest.
He was on a new story.</p>

<p>Ferry went away and Morning looked at the clock.
Only five minutes of his life had been used in this important
transaction. Nevin had not come&mdash;Nevin who
had lost his berth, thrown over his own work for him....
There would be no more <i>Nevin</i> on the <i>Sickles</i>.
Would he come East?</p>

<p>“Oh, I say, Field&mdash;drop the Ferry end of the story,”
Morning said.</p>

<p>“Sure,” said Field glibly.</p>

<p>“Nothing to it,” said Noyes.</p>

<p>Morning was too tired to go further, though he felt
their lie.</p>

<p>“But, Nevin,” he said to Noyes.</p>

<p>“I’ll have him found to-morrow. That’s the big
local thing to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Tell him&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>When Morning stopped telling Noyes and Field what
to tell Nevin for him, it was time to go for the ferry.
The <i>Polander</i> slipped out of Morning’s mind like a
dream&mdash;smoke, voices, glasses, indecent praise. Noyes
reached across the bar for a package. That last seemed
quite as important as anything.</p>

<p>They left him at the ferry&mdash;these men of the <i>Western
States</i>&mdash;servants of his action and his friends....
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111-4]</span>And somewhere in the city was little Nevin, who had
done his work and who had not come for his pay; somewhere
in the city, but apart from voices and adulation&mdash;the
man who had forgotten himself in telling the story
of how the news was brought in.... It was all
desperately unfinished. It hurt him every moment.</p>

<p>In the Pullman berth he opened the package Noyes
had given him; the porter brought a glass. Afterward,
he lay in the darkness. It was very still when he had
become accustomed to the wheels. The going always
had soothed him. In the still train and the peace of the
road, he heard at last that ringing again at the new door
of his life, and opened to Betty Berry, who had promised
to come.</p>

THE HILL-CABIN</h2></div>

<p class="ph2">1</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">M</span>orning</span> sat in the yielding leather of the <i>Boabdil</i>
library, quite as if he had passed his youth in the
midst of people who talk of doing things. Liaoyang had
been written, even the abandoned impediments of retreat
covered. It had all come to pass quite according to the
early ideas of Noyes and Field. John Morning was
Liaoyang in America. His book <i>Liaoyang</i>, magazine
and newspaper articles gathered together, was established
as important authority in encyclopædic and other
reference books. The most captious must grant that
living man can do no more than this.</p>

<p>Morning had dined with the president. One after
another he had made every magazine of note, and much
money. He had done his own story of the journey,
which proved more of a comment maker than the battle
description; and his article on the deck passages of the
Chinese coolies will always be an incentive to foreign
missions. New York had waited upon him, had exploited
him, given him bewildering payments, and called
him everything, even Hugoesque and Tolstoianic. It
was very hard for Morning to retain the conviction that
there wasn’t ten pages of all this copy that ranked in
sheer value with the ten pages of Fallows’ <i>Ploughman</i>.
He didn’t for awhile.</p>

<p>Liaoyang was on in full magazine blast in America,
while Mukden and Sha River were being fought across
the world. At this time Morning spent an hour a day,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>as war-expert for a particularly incessant daily newspaper
of New York. So all people knew what the campaign
was about, and what certain generals might do,
from past grooves of their wearing in history. Also
German gentlemen of military pasts wrote letters disputing
the prophecies. Morning had certainly arrived.</p>

<p>The condition or place of arrival was slippery. The
peace of Portsmouth had been protocoled.... Liaoyang,
deep in the valley of desuetude, was without
even the interest of perspective. The name, Liaoyang,
made the mind of the world lame.... Even in the
heat of arrival, the thing had puzzled him. Money ceased
to gladden him after a few mails; did not spare him
from the nearest irritation. Plainly he was quite the
same John Morning after appearing in the great magazines
as before; and the people whom he had interested
were mainly of the same sort that had come forward
in the <i>Polander</i> bar.</p>

<p>He had been a sick man since the Hun Crossing.
When the big New York task was finished, and it was
done with something of the same drive of will that characterized
the second writing of the main story on board
the <i>Sickles</i>, he was again ready to break, body and brain.
Running down entirely, he had reached that condition
which has an aversion to any task. His productive motors
had long lain in the dark, covered from the dust.
This was the time he clubbed about. The <i>Boabdil</i> was a
favorite, but even here, men drew up their chairs from
time to time, day and night, dispatching the waiter for
drink and saying:</p>

<p>“Those Japs are pretty good fighters, aren’t they?”
or, “What do you consider will become of China in the
event of&mdash;&mdash;” or, very cheerily, “Well, Mr. Morning,
are you waiting for another war?”</p>

<p>He slept ill; drank a very great deal; the wound in
his side had not healed and he had made no great friends.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>He thought of these four things on this particular mid-day
in the <i>Boabdil</i> library.... Nearby was old
Conrad with the morning papers, summoning the
strength to dine. It was usually late in the afternoon,
before he arose to the occasion, but with each stimulant,
he informed the nearest fellow-member that he was going
to eat something presently. The old man stopped
reading to think about it. After much conning, he decided
that he had better have just one more touch of
this with a dash of that&mdash;which he took slowly, listening
for comment from within.... After dinner
he would smoke himself to sleep and begin preparing for
the following morning’s chops. “Eat twice a day, sir&mdash;no
more&mdash;not for years.”</p>

<p>Conrad in his life had done one great thing. In
war-time, before the high duty was put on, he had accumulated
a vast cellar full of whiskey. That had meant
his hour. Riches, a half century of rich dinners, clean
collars and deep leather chairs&mdash;all from that whiskey
sale.... “Picturesque,” they said of Conrad at
the <i>Boabdil</i>. “What would the club do without
him?”...</p>

<p>Morning watching him now, remembered an old man
who used to sit at a certain table in a Sixth avenue bar.
The high price of whiskey had reversed conditions in
this case, and a changed collar meant funeral or festivity.
Forty years ago this old man had bred a colt that
became a champion. That was his hour, his answer for
living. After all, Morning concluded, having seen Conrad
fall asleep one night, the old horseman was less
indecent.</p>

<p>Finally Morning thought of the little Englishman
at Tongu and the blanket; then of Fallows and Nevin&mdash;Fallows
saying, “Come on upstairs,” that day of their
first meeting at the <i>Imperial</i>, and Nevin saying, “Well,
you gave me a night&mdash;&mdash;” .... Morning began to
laugh. “Picturesque, what-would-we-do-without Conrad”&mdash;sitting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
five days and nights on the deck passage
from the mouth of the Pei-ho to the lowest port of
Japan....</p>

<p>He hadn’t thought much of Nevin and Fallows and
the Tongu Endicott in the months that followed his
arrival from San Francisco, when the work went with
a rush. And Betty Berry&mdash;there were times when he
was half sure she&mdash;name, Armory and all&mdash;formed but
an added dream that Nevin had injected hypodermically
the night before.</p>

<p>Morning could think about all these now. The editors
had begun to tell what <i>they</i> wanted. He had sent
in stuff which did not meet their needs. He was linked
to war in their minds. Moreover, plentiful money had
brought to the surface again his unfinished passion to
gamble, as his present distaste for work had increased
the consumption of alcohol.... It was <i>Reverses</i>
that reminded him of Fallows and Nevin and the Tongu
blanket and the angel he had entertained in the Armory
room.</p>

<p>Editors didn’t care for his fiction. “A good war
story is all right any time,” they said, but apparently
his were not, for five or six trials didn’t take. He had a
tendency to remember Fallows when he wrote fiction.
The story of the Ploughman came curiously back to
mind, when he was turned loose from straight narrative,
and he was “balled” between planes.... He
thought of a play....</p>

<p>Varce now came into the library and drew up a chair.
Varce had one of his stories; Varce edited a magazine
that sold several million every two weeks. Long ago,
with great effort, and by paying prodigiously, Varce had
secured from Morning one of the final tiles of the great
Liaoyang mosaic.... Varce was tall, a girl’s
dream of poet-knight&mdash;black, wavy hair, straight excellent
features, a figure lean enough for modern
clothes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span></p>

<p>“Morning,” he said, “do you know the fighting
game?”</p>

<p>“You mean pugilistically?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I used to do fights.”</p>

<p>Varce went on presently:</p>

<p>“A great series of articles is to be written on the
boyhood and general atmosphere of the men who have
made great ring history&mdash;big stuff, you know&mdash;well
written&mdash;from a man who can see the natural phenomena
of these bruisers&mdash;how they are bred and all that. Now
three things go into the fighter&mdash;punch, endurance, but,
most of all, instinct&mdash;the stuff that doesn’t let him ‘lay
down’ when the going is rough, and doesn’t keep him
from putting the wallop on a groggy opponent. Many
a good fighter has missed championship because he was
too tender-hearted to knock-out a helpless&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Do you like that story of mine you have, Varce?”
Morning asked yawning.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s a good enough story&mdash;a bit socialistic&mdash;what
are you trying to get at?”</p>

<p>“No need of me furnishing diagrams, if the manuscript
leaves you that way,” Morning said. “You were
just saying about the last touch to a beating&mdash;yes, I’ve
heard about those three things&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Do you want the series?”</p>

<p>“No, I’m doing a play.”</p>

<p>... After Varce had gone, Morning thought it all
out again. Varce was living a particularly unmitigated
lie. Five years ago he had done some decent verse. He
had a touch of the real poetic vision, and he had turned
it to trade. He was using it now to catch the crowd.
An especially sensational prostitution, this&mdash;one that
would make the devil scratch his head.... And
Varce could do without him. Liaoyang had not made
the name of John Morning imperative. Moreover, he
himself was living rotten. He wished he had told Varce
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>what he thought of him and his multi-millionaire subscription....
He hadn’t; he had merely spoken of
his play. The bridges were not burned behind him. He
might be very glad to do a series of “pug” stories for
Varce. There were good stories in these fighters&mdash;but
the good stories, as he saw them, were not what Varce
saw in the assignment.</p>

<p>It summed up that he was just beginning over again;
that he must beat the game all over again in a different
and larger dimension&mdash;or else quit.... He ordered
a drink.... He could always see himself.
That was a Morning faculty, the literary third eye. He
saw himself doing a series of the fighters&mdash;saw it even
to the red of the magazine covers, and the stuff of the
announcements.... John Morning, the man who
did fifty-mile fronts at Liaoyang, putting all his unparalleled
battle color in the action of a 24-foot ring.
Then the challenge to the reader: “Can you stand a descriptive
force of this calibre? If you can, read the story
of the great battle between Ambi Viles and Two-pill
Terry in next issue.”... He would have to tell
seriously before the battle description, however, how
Ambi was a perfect gentleman and the sole support of
his mother, an almost human English gentlewoman. It
is well to be orthodox.</p>

<p>Somebody spoke of whiskey in the far end of the
library, insisting on a certain whiskey, and old Conrad
cocked up his ears out of a meaty dream....
Morning closed his eyes. He felt the warmth of a ship
beneath, the drive of the cold rain on deck and the
heaving of the sea. There was something almost sterile-clean
about that deck-passage, compared to this....
Then he remembered again the men he had known, and
the woman who came to the Armory room&mdash;and the
long breath his soul took, with her coming....
Finally he saw himself years hence, as if he had quit
the fight now and taken New York and Varce as they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>meant to use him.... He was sunk in leather,
blown up like an inner tube and showing red, stalled in
some club library, and forcing the world to remember
Liaoyang, bringing down the encyclopædia to show his
name, when extra drunk.... No, he would be
hanging precariously to some porter job on Sixth avenue,
trying to make the worn and tattered edges of his world
believe how he had once carried the news from Liaoyang
to Koupangtse....</p>

<p>A saddle-horse racked by on the asphalt, and turned
into the park. Morning arose. There was stabbing and
scalding from the unhealed wound in his side. The pain
reminded him of the giants he had once known and of
the woman who came to the Armory room. It had always
been so; always something about him unsound,
something that would not heal. He had accepted
eagerly, but ever his giving had been paltry. And he
had to be pulled down, out of the shine of fortune, before
he remembered how great other men had been to
him.</p>

<p class="ph2">2</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>hat</span> night he dreamed that he had passed through
death.... He was standing upon a cliff, between
the Roaming Country and a valley of living earth.
He did not want the spirit region; in his dream he turned
his back upon it. He did not want the stars. Illusion
or not, he wanted the earth. He looked down upon it
through the summer night, down through the tree-tops
into a valley that lay in the soft warm dusk. He
watched with the passion and longing of a newly-dead
mother, who hears her child crying for her, and senses
the desolation of her mate.... The breath of earth
came up to him through the exhaling leaves&mdash;leaves
that whispered in the mist. He could have kissed the
soil below for sheer love of it. He wanted the cool,
damp earth in his hands, and the thick leaf-mould under
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>his feet, and the calm wide listening of the trees....
Stars were near enough, but earth was not. He wanted
to be down, down in the drip of the night. He would
wait in ardor for the rain of the valley.... Looking
down through the tree-tops, he sensed the earth passion,
the lovely sadness of it&mdash;and desired it, even if he
must die again.... There was an ache in the desire&mdash;like
the ache of thirst that puts all other thoughts
away, and turns the dream and the picture to running
water.</p>

<p>He awoke, and went to his window in the dark. He
saw New York and realized that he was dying for the
country. His eyes smarted to tears, when he remembered
rides and journeys and walks he had taken over
the earth, so thoughtlessly, without knowing their boon
and beauty and privilege.... While he was standing
there, that which he had conceived as To-morrow,
became To-day, and appeared over the rim of the opposite
gorge of apartments. The first light of it sank far
down into the tarry stuffiness of the pavement, but the
dew that fell with the dawn-light was pure as heaven
to his nostrils.</p>

<p>That day he crossed the river, and at the end of a
car-line beyond Hackensack, walked for a half-hour. It
was thus that Morning found his hill. Just a lifted corner
of a broad meadow, with a mixed company of fine
trees atop. He bought it before dusk. The dairyman’s
farmhouse was a quarter-mile distant; the road, a hundred
and fifty yards from the crest of the hill, with
trees thinly intervening. The south was open to even
wider fields; in the far distance to the west across the
meadows, the sky was sharpened by a low ribbon of
woods and hill-land. In the east was the suspended
silence of the Hudson.</p>

<p>“I want a pump and a cabin, and possibly a shed for
a horse,” he said, drinking a glass of buttermilk, at the
dairyman’s door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span></p>

<p>He was directed to Hackensack.</p>

<p>With the falling darkness again upon the hills, he
saw that certain crowded, mid-growth trees were better
down. The fine thought of building his cabin of them
occurred. By the time he reached Hackensack, the house
of logs was so dear in thought, that he wanted nothing
short of a cabinet-joiner for such a precious task. That
night he met Jake Robin, who was sick of nailing at
houses in rows, a job that had long since ceased to afford
deep breaths to his capacity.</p>

<p>The next day Morning moved to Hackensack, and
Jake was at work.... Three thousand he had lost
gambling ... he wished he had it now. Much
more had been lost, and not so cleanly, in reaching the
final <i>Boabdil</i> realization, but he had enough. Presently
he was helping Jake, and there was joy in it.</p>

<p>They tapped a spring some thirty feet beneath the
humped shoulder of the hill; built a shed for the horse
he had not yet found, and then fitted the cabin to the
fire-place of concrete and valley stone. One sizeable
room it was, that faced the open south from the brow
of the hill.</p>

<p>A fine unfolding&mdash;this love of Morning’s for wood
itself, and woods. Over a half-hundred trees were his
own&mdash;elm, beech, hickory, oak, ash, and maple&mdash;and like
a fine clean colony of idealists they stood meditating....
One never knows the quality of wood until one
builds his own house. Opening the timbers for the big
mortices&mdash;each was a fresh and fragrant discovery. Jake
and he lingered long, after the cabin was roofed, over
the heavy oak flooring, and the finishing of windows
and doors and frames. They built some furniture together
of hickory, which is a wood a man should handle
with reverence, for it is fine in its way as wheat and
grapes and honey and wild olives. Hickory answers
graciously to the work of the hand, and, like a good dog,
flourishes with men.... They built a table and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>bed-frame and a chest of drawers; and Morning at last
went to Hackensack for pots, kettles, and tea things.
Jake Robin, like one who has built a ship, was loath to
leave without trying the cabin. Morning kept him busy
in the clearing, long after he was in the mood to start
work on the play. There was a platform to build for the
pump; also a certain rustic bench. The shed needed
tinkering; an extra cabinet for books was indispensable&mdash;and
screens.... No one had ever let Jake play
before in his life.... Moreover, he was paid for
the extra hour required to walk to and from town. All
Hack heard about it.</p>

<p>“You’ll need a chicken-coop&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No,” said Morning. The look on Jake’s face was
like old Amoya’s in Tokyo, when the rickshaw-runner
was forbidden to take him to the Yoshuwara.</p>

<p>“I can fit you up a little ice-box near the spring&mdash;so’s
you’ll pump it full of water, and keep your vittles&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Morning wanted the stillness for the play, but he
couldn’t refuse. Two days more. Then Jake scratched
his head.</p>

<p>“You’ll be wantin’ a vine on the cabin,” he ventured.
“I know the man who has the little ivies.”</p>

<p>This was irresistible. “Can you see me owning a
vine?” asked Morning. Yet there was significance in the
idea together with the play.</p>

<p>“And I’ll build a bit of a trainer to start it. By the
end of summer&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Bring it on, Jake&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“An’ I’ll fetch a couple of rose vines, and dreen them
with broken crockery from the holler&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The vine prospered and the play; and the roses began
to feel for Jake’s trellis. The tool-box was still there.</p>

<p>“You’ll be needin’ fire-wood for the winter. To be
sure, you can buy it, but what’s the good, with dead stuff
to be knocked down and small trees to be thinned out,
and the shed gapin’ open for the saddle-horse you’re not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>sure of findin’? It’s wood you ought to have in
there&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>In fact, it was no small task to break Jake of the hill-habit.
Morning grew accustomed to the ax, and the
crashing of branches, many of which would have been
sacrificed to the strong winds of the Fall. Meanwhile,
the shed had come into its own, and there were piles
of firewood seasoning in the sun and shade.</p>

<p>He was alone with the nights; sitting there in his
doorway when it was fine, studying the far lights of the
city.... City lights meant Varce and Conrad, not
his great friends. Every hour that he looked, he liked
better the wind about the doorway and the open southern
fields.</p>

<p>One night he felt his first twinge of sorrow for the
big city. Hatred, it had been before. Other men were
tortured as he had been, but somehow, the way didn’t
get into their dreams and drive them forth, as he had
been driven. They were really not to blame for <i>Boabdilling</i>;
they sank into the cushions and lost the sense of
reality. And then the thousands in the hall-bedrooms
and worse, to whom <i>Boabdil</i> was heaven’s farthest pavilion!
Morning seemed to have something to say to
those thousands, but wasn’t ready yet.</p>

<p>He longed for Fallows, whom he saw more clearly
every day&mdash;especially since the <i>Ploughman</i> had crept
into the play.... He wanted to wait upon the big
sick man; to have him here, to prepare food for him,
and sit with him in these silences. He wanted Endicott
at Tongu, too, and Nevin&mdash;oh, yes, Nevin. It was like
a prayer that he sent out some nights&mdash;for the unearthing
of these giants from their hiding&mdash;so that he could
listen to them, and serve them and make them glad for
their giving to him.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A deep summer night. The purple of the north
seemed washed and thinned in ether, (nothing else could
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>bring out the heavenly lustre of it), and the black, fragile
top-foliage of the woods leaned against it, listening, feminine.
Darkness only on the ground; yet he loved it, the
heart of the dusk that throbbed there. He loved the
earth and the water that mingled in the hollows. He
breathed with strange delight the air that brushed the
grass and the clover-scent that came to him around the
hill.... And this was the momentary passion&mdash;that
he was going from all this. He loved it as one who
was passing beyond. It was like the dream after all.
Just as Mother Earth was unfolding, he was called. She
was like a woman long lived-with, but unknown, until
the sudden revelation of parting.... He touched
the stones with his hand.</p>

<p>In the hush, waiting for a katydid to answer, that
night, Morning fell asleep.... He had climbed to
his cabin, as if it were a room on an upper floor. Before
he opened the door, he knew someone was within.
Before the light, it was clear that someone was curled
up asleep on the foot of his hard bed.... Yes, it
was she who had restored his soul, that day at the
Armory&mdash;and there she lay sleeping.... He did
not call her, as he had called Moto-san; there was no
thought to waken her, for everything was so pure and
lovely about it. He stood there, and watched her gratefully&mdash;it
seemed a long time&mdash;until the katydid answered.</p>

<p class="ph2">3</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter</span> Markheim had kept the play three months&mdash;it
was now November&mdash;Morning crossed to
the city to force the decision. The producer was prevailed
upon to see him.</p>

<p>“It will be read once more,” said Markheim. “It
will go or not. We like it, but we are afraid of it. To-morrow
we will know or not.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span></p>
<p>“What are you afraid of?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I do not read plays.”</p>

<p>“To-morrow?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Markheim bought his opinions, and was attentive to
those which cost the most....</p>

<p>Morning drew a napkin the size of a doll’s handkerchief
from a pile. A plate of eggs and bacon rung, as
if hitting a bull’s-eye upon the white marble before him.
He was still wondering what Markheim was afraid of.
He didn’t like the feel of it. The Lowenkampf of Duke
Fallows’ had crept into the play&mdash;Lowenkampf, whose
heart was pulled across the world by the mother and
child. How they had broken his concentration on the
eve of the great battle.</p>

<p>At the time, he had seen the tragic sentimentalist as
one caught in a master weakness, but all that was gone.
Lowenkampf still moved white in his fancy, while the
other generals, even Mergenthaler, had become like the
dim mounds in his little woodland.... And what
a dramatic thing, to have a woman and a child breaking
in upon the poised force of a vast Russian army.
It was like Judith going down into the valley-camp of the
Assyrians and smiting the neck of Holofernes with his
own fauchion. Morning’s mind trailed away in the
fascination of Fallows, and in the dimension he had
been unable to grasp in those black hours of blood....
So many things were different after this summer
alone; yet he had never seemed quite rested, neither
in mind nor body.... He had been all but unkillable
like the sorrel Eve before that journey from
Liaoyang to New York. Now, even after the ease and
moral healing of the summer alone, his wound was unhealed....</p>

<p>The telephone-miss in Markheim’s reception-room
was very busy when he called the next afternoon....
Something about her reminded him of <i>Mio
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>Amigo</i>. She was a good deal sharper. Was it the brass
handle?... To hear her, one would think that she
had come in late, and that New York needed scolding,
even spanking, which exigencies of time and space deferred
for the present. Her words were like the ‘spat,
spat, spat,’ of a spanking.... She was like an
angry robin, too, at one end of a worm. She bent and
pulled, but the worm had a strangle-hold on a stone.
It gave, but would not break.... Morning saw the
manuscript at this point on her side-table, and the fun
of the thing was done.... She looked up, trailed
a soft <i>arpeggio</i> on the lower-right of her board, grasped
the manuscript firmly, and shoved it to him.</p>

<p>“Mr. Morning to see Mr. Markheim,” he said.</p>

<p>“Mr. Markheim is&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>But the husky voice of the producer just now reached
them from within.</p>

<p>“Busy&mdash;&mdash;” she finished with a cough.... New
York was at it again. <i>Stuyvesant</i> especially had a devil,
and <i>Bryant</i> was the last word.</p>

<p>“... You can’t see Mr. Markheim. This is your
message&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, it really isn’t. This is just an incident. I hesitate
to trouble you, but I must see Mr. Markheim.”</p>

<p>The play was wrapped in the identical paper in which
it had been brought.</p>

<p>She must have touched something, for a boy came in&mdash;a
younger brother, past doubt&mdash;but so bewildered, as
to have become habitually staring.</p>

<p>“Tell Mr. Markheim, Mr. Morning insists on seeing
him.”</p>

<p>The boy seemed on the point of falling to his knees
to beg for mercy. Morning’s personal distemper subsided.
Here was a drama, too&mdash;the great American
stage.... One word came out to him from Markheim:</p>

<p>“In-zists!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span></p>

<p>“How do you do, Mr. Morning&mdash;good afternoon.”</p>

<p>Markheim had his hand in a near drawer, and was
smiling with something the same expression that old
Conrad used when listening for the dinner notice.</p>

<p>“You see we do not want it&mdash;we are afraid,” he began,
and becoming suddenly hopeful, since Morning
drew forth no bomb, he added, “You have a girl’s idea
of war, Mr. Morning&mdash;good afternoon.”</p>

<p>He liked his joke on the name. “We were in doubt
about the war part&mdash;afraid&mdash;and so we consulted an
expert&mdash;one who was on the spot,” he said pleasantly.</p>

<p>Morning’s mind was searching New York; his idea
was fateful.</p>

<p>“We are not bermidded to divulge who the expert is,
but we did not spare money&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Morning’s eye was held to the desk over the shoulder
of Markheim, to a large square envelope, eminent in
blue, upon the corner of which was the name “Reever
Kennard.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure you did not. He was always a high-priced
man,” he said idly.... And so this was the long-delayed
answer to his appearance in the <i>World-News</i> to
the extent of eighty thousand words. He had heard that
Mr. Reever Kennard was back on finance and politics....
Markheim had not followed his mind nor caught
the sentence. Morning passed out through the hush.
He paused at the door to give the office-boy a present&mdash;a
goodly present to be divided with the sister, just now
occupied with a fresh outbreak of obstreperousness on
the part of <i>Gramercy</i>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Morning had moments of something like the old
rage; but the extreme naturalness of the thing, and its
touch of humor, helped him over for the next hour or
so. Apparently, the opportunity had fallen into the lap
of Mr. Reever Kennard; come to him with homing
familiarity. The war-expert had spoken, not as one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>offering his values gratuitously, but as one called and
richly paid. Morning reflected that the summer alone
on his hill must have subdued him. As a matter of fact,
he was doubtful about the play; not because Markheim
was afraid; not by any means because Mr. Reever Kennard
had spoken, but because it had not come easily, and
the three incidents which made the three acts did not
stand up in his mind as the exact trinity for the integration
of results. But one cannot finally judge his own
work.</p>

<p>He wandered straight east from that particular theatre
of Markheim’s where the offices were and passed
Fourth Avenue. He never went quite that way again,
but remembered that there was an iron picket-fence of
an old residence to lean against; and at the corner of it,
nearer town, the sidewalk sank into a smoky passage
where lobsters, chops, and a fowl or two were tossed together
in front. It was all but dark. He was averse
to taking his present mood across the river. It wasn’t
fair to the cabin. <i>Mio Amigo</i> recurred queerly and
often to mind....</p>

<p>“Look&mdash;there’s Mr. Morning&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Sh-sh&mdash;oh, Charley&mdash;sh-sh!”</p>

<p>Morning was compelled. Could this little shrinking
creature, beside whom the under-sized brother now appeared
hulking, be the same who had bossed Manhattan
to a peak in his presence such a little while ago? She
seemed terrified, all pointed for escape, sick from the
strain of the street.</p>

<p>“Why, hello!” Morning said.</p>

<p>She pulled her brother on, saying with furious effort
of will, “I’m sure we’re much obliged for your present&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I had forgotten that,” Morning said.</p>

<p>“We’re going to take in the show,” the boy remarked,
drawing back. At large, thus, he was much better to
look upon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span></p>

<p>“Come on, Charley&mdash;we mustn’t detain&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Morning had an idea, and looked at the sister as he
said, “Won’t you have supper with me somewhere? I
have nothing&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Her face was livid&mdash;as if all the fears of a lifetime
had culminated into the dreadful impendings of this
moment. She tried to speak.... Then it came to
Morning in a belated way that she thought she was
accosted; that she connected his gift with this meeting.
He couldn’t let her go now&mdash;and yet, it was hard for
him to know what to say.</p>

<p>“I mean we three,” he began hastily. “This play being
refused rather knocked me out, and I didn’t know
what to do with the evening. I don’t live in New York,
you know. I thought you and your brother&mdash;that we
might have supper together&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He spoke on desperately, trying to stir to life the
little magpie sharpness again. It was more to her
brother she yielded. New York must have frightened
her terribly.... Morning managed to get down
to the pair that night. He was clumsy at it, however,
for it was a new emprise. Mostly John Morning had
been wrapped and sealed in his own ideas. The boy
was won with the first tales of war, but the sister remained
apart with her terrors. No one had taught her
that kindness may be a motive in itself.</p>

<p>And now Morning was coping with what seemed a
real idea: What was the quality of the switch-board that
harnessed her character? Here she was wild and disordered&mdash;like
a creature denied her drug. With that
mystic rumble of angry New York in her ears&mdash;the
essential buzz of a million desires passing through her&mdash;she
was a force, flying and valuable force. Was she
lain open to obsession now because she was removed
from that slavery? Was that maddening vibration the
lost key to her poise?</p>

<p>He tried hard, not daring to be attentive in the least.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>She would have fled, if he had. He was boyishly kind
to her brother. That awed, and was beginning to hold
her.</p>

<p>Morning saw clearly that she stood like a stretched
wing between her brother’s little soul and the world.
She could be brave in sheltering Charley. The boy was
really alive. He ate and answered and listened and lived,
the show ahead.... In the midst of it, Morning
awoke to the fact that he was having a good time; and
here was the mystery&mdash;with the last two people in New
York he would have chosen; a two, his whole life-business
had taught him to employ thoughtlessly, as other
metropolitan adjuncts&mdash;pavements, elevators, messengers.
Here was life in all its terror and complication,
the same struggles he had known; yet he had always
seen himself as a sort of Titan alone in the great destroying
elements. The joke was on him.</p>

<p>Charley left them for just a moment. The sister
said, as if thinking aloud:</p>

<p>“... And yet, he cries every morning because
he has to go to the office. Oh, he wouldn’t go there
without me&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>A world of meaning in that. They were sitting in
the dark of the <i>Charity Union</i> play-house, with Charley
between them. The aims and auspices of the performance
were still indefinite to Morning, who had not ceased
to grapple with his joke&mdash;the seriousness with which he
had habitually regarded John Morning, his house, his
play, his unhealed wound, his moral debility....</p>

<p>For fifteen minutes a giant had marvelously manhandled
his companion. The curtain dropped an instant,
and in the place where the giant had performed now
stood a ’cello and a chair.... She came on like
the wraith of an angel&mdash;and sat down and played....
How long she played Morning never knew, but
somewhere in it he caught his breath as one who had
come back to life.... And then she was gone.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>The audience was mildly applauding. He turned to the
sister leaning on the knees of the boy:</p>

<p>“I know her. She is very dear to me. If you don’t
mind, I’ll leave you now. You are safe with Charley&mdash;and
some time again I’ll come. I thank you very much.
I really want to do this again&mdash;we three&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Even though his own joy was bewildering, he saw the
sudden happiness of Charley’s sister, who, in spite of
all, had been haunted by the dread of the <i>afterward</i>.
Now that was gone from her. Relief was in her face.
It was all so much better than she had dared to hope.
He had wanted nothing&mdash;except to be kind&mdash;and now
he was going. She gave her hand impulsively....
Charley did, too, and was ordered to call a carriage
for his sister if he wished; at all events, the means
was attended.... Then they saw him making his
way forward&mdash;putting money into the hands of ushers,
and inquiring the way to the stage.... And she
was there, playing again.</p>

<p class="ph2">4</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">S</span>he</span> was making the people like her. Her effect was
gradual. They had been held by more obvious displays.
The instrument seemed very big for her, but the
people liked her all the better for this.... He
could not be one with the audience, but the old watching
literary eye&mdash;the third eye&mdash;caught the sense of the people’s
growing delight. She made them feel that she belonged
to them; as if she said:</p>

<p>“I have come back to you. I will do just what you
ask. Everything I have is yours&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>It was different and dearer to John Morning than
anything he had ever known. The picture came clearly
to him as he walked around behind.... This was
the hour of her return. She had gone from the hearts
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>of her people long ago to bring back music. It was the
beautiful old story of their sacrifice to send her away.
How splendidly she had learned; how thrillingly they
remembered her beginnings. And she had never forgotten;
she would always love and thank them&mdash;indeed,
she was happier than any now.... Morning was
lost for a moment in his story.</p>

<p>She was approaching, but did not see him yet. The
house was pleased with her, not noisily, but pleasantly.
She turned to bow to the people&mdash;and then back toward
the wings. She saw him standing there. Her arms went
out to him, though she had not quitted the stage....
The gesture was new to the people.... It was
different from her coming to him at the Armory....
They were standing together.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you go on again?” a voice said, and with
a queer irritation in the tone.</p>

<p>... She was playing again&mdash;and with dash and
power.</p>

<p>Morning had to shut his eyes now, really to hear; and
yet, he could not summon her face to mind when his
eyes were shut. He thought with a quick burn of shame
that he had once wished her prettier. Sadness followed,
for, it seemed to him, their meeting had been broken.
She belonged to the people and not to him. They loved
her.... She was different. He saw it now. The
audience, so pleased and joyous, lifted her in a way perhaps
that he could never do.</p>

<p>It was everywhere&mdash;the music. It filled the high,
brick-walled stage, vibrated in the spiral stairways,
moved mysteriously in the upper darkness and immensity.
Behind the far wings a man was moving up and
down in a sort of enchantment&mdash;no, he was memorizing
something. A few of the far front rows were visible
from where Morning stood, and the forward boxes
opposite....</p>

<p>Morning was wandering in a weird land, a hollow
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>land. The woman’s playing was between him and the
world of men; half for them, half for him. The Memorizer
was but another phantom, wandering with the
ghost of a manuscript. Between Morning and the player
was only the frail, fluent current of music. This was a
suspense of centuries.... Would she go to <i>Them</i>,
or return to Him? The tall, dim canvases were fields
of emptiness and silence, in which he wandered listening,
tortured with tension; and the loft was sunless,
moonless, unearthly....</p>

<p>The music ceased. He heard the calling of the other
world to her. He was apart in the shadows. Would
she go to them, or would she remember him, waiting?...
She was coming. He heard her step behind the
wings. It was light as a gloved hand upon a table. He
was hungry and athirst and breathless. For the first
time he saw that her throat and arms were bare....
They were standing together again, but the Other Phantom
intercepted.</p>

<p>It was the Memorizing Man. He came forward in
an agony of excitement. “You’ll have to prompt me,”
he said to Betty Berry, speaking roughly in his tension.
“It’s my first time with this new dope. I thought I had
it, but I ain’t&mdash;and there’s a barrel of it.”</p>

<p>The stage was slightly changed. Morning was thinking
how hideous the work of some men. The Phantom
was scourged with the fear of one who was to do imperfectly
what another had written. The woman had carried
a small table and chair to the wings, out of view
of the audience and as near as possible to the Memorizer....
Morning found something soft and
fragrant in his hands. Betty Berry’s wrap, which she
had given to him before going to the table. And now
the monologue had begun.... It was to be humorous.</p>

<p>Betty Berry, standing beside the table, raised her
eyes from the paper, and beckoned to Morning. His
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>first thought was that he might disturb her prompting,
and he hesitated. She looked up again. Then he thought
she might want her wrap. He tiptoed forward and put
it around her shoulders.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t that,” she whispered, her eyes upon the
paper. “I wanted you to keep me company. This is
long. Sit down.”</p>

<p>“Won’t <i>you</i>&mdash;sit down?” he said from behind, very
close to her hair.</p>

<p>She shook her head.... It was peculiar&mdash;she
standing, and he in the chair. The soft wrap winged
out, and her arm beneath slid across his shoulder; the
hollow of her left arm against his cheek. He kissed it,
and his face burned against its coolness.</p>

<p>She shivered slightly, but did not take her arm away.
Now he looked up into her face&mdash;her eyelids drawn, her
lips compressed, her gaze steadily held to the manuscript.
The Phantom was carried on by the alien humor.
Laughter was beginning to crackle here and there
through the house. Betty Berry followed with her eyes&mdash;just
the words.</p>

<p>“I was so glad to find you,” Morning whispered.</p>

<p>Her lips moved.</p>

<p>Matters tumbled over each other in his mind to say
to her; he was thinking sentences rather than words.
He knew that it was not well to talk now, but there
seemed so much to say, and so little time. He caught
himself promising to give her understanding, and he
told her that she seemed everything he wanted to know.
His cheek was burning as never before....</p>

<p>The remotest happened. The Phantom faltered in
a climax, and covered the difficulty with a trick&mdash;awaiting
the line from the wings. Betty Berry had become
rigid. Her eyes would not see the page.</p>

<p>Morning spoke a sentence in a low, carrying way.
He had plucked it from the page painfully near his own
eyes. It may be that the Memorizer righted himself, or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>that the prompted line was what he needed. Anyway,
he was going again, and rising to the end....</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The two stood together while the house laughed, recalling
the performer.</p>

<p>“Thanks. I caught it fine,” the Phantom said hastily.
“Not even the front rows knew. I was listening for
Miss Berry&mdash;and your cue came&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It went all right,” said Morning.</p>

<p>The other took the manuscript and passed on, rolling
a cigarette.... For just a moment, the two
were alone. Into each other’s arms they went, with the
superb thoughtlessness of children ... and then
they heard steps and voices.... He wondered
that Betty Berry could laugh and reply to those who
spoke to her.... He wanted to escape with her.
Never had he wanted anything so much. He was exhausted,
humbled, inspired. To be out in the street with
her&mdash;it seemed almost too good to be.... She was
saying good-night and good-bye. He followed, carrying
the ’cello.</p>

<p class="ph2">5</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">M</span>orning</span> remembered that he had thought of her
once before as having braids down behind&mdash;as if
they were boy and girl together, and now it seemed as
if they were wandering through some Holland street.
He had never been in a Holland street, but the sense of
it came to him&mdash;as he walked with her, carrying her
instrument. His primary instinct was to turn away
from the noise of the cars, and where the lights were
less glaring. Moreover, now that they were alone, the
impulse to say many things had left him.</p>

<p>“We must hurry to the ferry&mdash;there is only a few
minutes&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He had known somehow that she was going away&mdash;perhaps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
from something she had said to the others at
the theatre.</p>

<p>“You’re not going way back to&mdash;to the Armory?”</p>

<p>“No, to Europe just for a few weeks. I sail to-morrow
morning from Baltimore. All we have to do is
to catch the ferry and train. I have sleeper-tickets&mdash;and
berth and all&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I’ll&mdash;I’ll go across on the ferry with you,” he said
huskily.</p>

<p>She felt his suffering by her own, and said:</p>

<p>“My old master is there. I am to meet him&mdash;I think
in Paris&mdash;I shall know when I reach London. There is
to be just a few private concerts and some lessons further
from him. For two years we’ve planned to do this.
I go to Baltimore, because it is cheaper to sail from
there&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And you’ll be back&mdash;when?”</p>

<p>“By the first of March&mdash;just a few days over three
months&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He was silent for a time, and then asked: “Do you
think this is just like a chance meeting to me&mdash;as one
meets an old friend in New York?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“I was in a whirl when I saw you,” he said desperately.
“It was such a pretty thing, too&mdash;the way I happened
to come to the theatre ... and now you’re
going away&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;but it’s only a little while&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Did you know I was here in New York?”</p>

<p>“I knew you had been. I saw your work&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But anywhere my work appears&mdash;a letter sent in
care of the paper or magazine would find me&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“We&mdash;I mean women&mdash;do not write that way&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I know&mdash;I know.... But <i>I</i> didn’t have anything
but the name, ‘Betty Berry’&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“It seemed that night after I left you at the Armory
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>everyone was talking about John Morning. And to
think I supposed you just a soldier. Everywhere, it was
what John Morning had done, and what he had endured&mdash;and
I had spent the afternoon with you. I started to
read that story about your journey, but I couldn’t go on.
It seemed that I would die before I was half through
your sufferings.... I would try to think of the
things we said, but they didn’t come back. I couldn’t
rest. I was glad you asked me to come again. I could
hardly wait for the morning&mdash;to go back to the
Armory&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He had no answer. They were in a cross-town car.</p>

<p>“But I think I understand. We won’t say anything
of that again....”</p>

<p>“You went back to the Armory that next morning?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, but I wasn’t ready,” he said at last, as if goaded
by pain. “I had so much to learn. Why, I had to learn
this&mdash;how little this means&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He pointed out of the windows to the city streets.</p>

<p>“You mean New York?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It really seems as if men must learn that, first of all.
You have done well to learn so soon.”</p>

<p>“It’s so different now. I must have been half-unconscious
that day when you came. You were like an angel.
I didn’t know until afterward what it really meant to
me.... You remember the men who came&mdash;newspaper
men? They showed me what I could do in New
York&mdash;how I could make the magazines and the big
markets. I was knocked-out. You must see it&mdash;all I
wanted to do in coming years&mdash;to make what seemed
the real literary markets&mdash;all was to be done in a few
weeks.... It was not until I was on the train that
night that I remembered you were a living woman, and
had come to me.... Then I didn’t know what to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>do.... But ever since I have thought of that afternoon,
every day....”</p>

<p>They boarded the ferry and moved away from the
rest of the people.</p>

<p>“I hate to have you go,” he said. The words were
wrung from him. They were such poor and common
words, but his every process of thought repeated them.
He looked back the years, and found a single afternoon
in the midst of passionate waste&mdash;the single afternoon
in which she came.... She was everything to him.
He wanted to go on and on this way, carrying her ’cello.
He could ask no more than to have her beside him. He
had learned the rest&mdash;it was trash and suffering. He
wanted to tell her all he knew&mdash;not in the tension of this
momentary parting&mdash;but during days and years, to tell
his story and have her sanction upon what was done, and
to be done. She was dear; peace was with her....
She would tell him all that was mysterious; together
they would be One Who Knew. Together they would
work&mdash;do the things that counted, and learn faith....</p>

<p>She took the ’cello from him, so that he could carry
to the Pullman her large case checked in the Jersey station....
It was very quiet and dark in the coach.
All the berths were made up but one, in which they sat
down.... They were alone. It was perfect.</p>

<p>“I can’t go back now. I’ll go on with you to Trenton....
I have thought so much of meeting you....
When the men came that day to the Armory
they showed me everything that seemed good then&mdash;fame
and money waiting in New York. It seemed that
it couldn’t wait another day&mdash;that I must go that night....
When the train started (it was like this in Oakland)
I thought of you&mdash;of you, back in ’Frisco and
coming to the Armory in the morning. It broke me.
But I wasn’t right&mdash;not normal. I had worked like a
madman&mdash;wounds and all. I worked like a madman in
New York&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span></p>

<p>She put her hand on his. Her listening centered him.
That was it&mdash;as if he had not been whirling true before....
Her hand, her listening, and he was himself&mdash;eager
to give her all that was real.</p>

<p>“It’s so good to have you here,” she said in a low,
satisfied way. “Will you be able to get a train back all
right?”</p>

<p>“Yes.” Now he thought of Charley and his sister.</p>

<p>“It was such a good little thing that brought me to
you,” he said. “One of the little things that I never
thought of before,” he told her hurriedly.</p>

<p>“They are very wonderful&mdash;those little things, as
you call them.... A person is so safe in doing
them&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I must tell Duke Fallows about that,” he added.
“About that word ‘safe,’ as you just said it....
Did you read his story?”</p>

<p>“About the <i>Ploughman</i>?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it was wonderful!” Betty Berry said. “He
made me see it. It was almost worth a war to make
people see that&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>She stopped strangely. He was bending close,
watching her.</p>

<p>“Do you know you are a love-woman?”</p>

<p>“You mean something different?” she asked queerly.</p>

<p>“I mean you are everything&mdash;don’t you see? You
know everything at once that I have to get bruised and
tortured to know. And when you are here, I know
where I am. It’s different from any kind of resting to
be here with you. It’s kind of being made over. And
then you are so&mdash;tender&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You make the tears come, John Morning.”</p>

<p>Now, it was very dark where they were; the real
silences began. He knew the most wonderful thing
about her&mdash;her listening.... Sometimes, she
seemed hardly there. Sometimes the love for her and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>the sweet quality of it all&mdash;shut his throat, and he stared
away in the dark. It came to him that Betty Berry&mdash;left
to herself&mdash;would be infallible. She might do
wrong, through the will of someone else, but her own
impulses were unerringly right. There was delicacy,
perhaps, from the long summer alone, in this sense that
he must not impose his will. She would be unable to
refuse anything possible. If ever Betty Berry were
forced to refuse anything he asked, they would never be
the same together. And so he studied her. Her nature
was like something that enfolded. It was like an atmosphere&mdash;his
own element.</p>

<p>“Betty&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Betty&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;&mdash;-”</p>

<p>And then she laughed and kissed him. He was saying
her name in the very hush of contemplation; so real
that the name was all....</p>

<p class="ph2">6</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> Pullman conductor passing through after
Trenton gave Morning further passage, and
moved on with a smile. A wonderful old darkey was the
porter, very huge, past seventy, with a voice purringly
kind, and the genial deference of the Old South. Morning
was thinking there couldn’t be better hands in which
to leave the Betty Berry.... Fifteen minutes at
Philadelphia; they hurried out for a cup of coffee. As
one of the big station clocks marked the minutes, Morning
felt havoc with a new and different force.</p>

<p>“I can’t go back now,” he said.</p>

<p>“You look so tired&mdash;the long night journey back&mdash;&mdash;”
she faltered.</p>

<p>“Would you like to have me go farther&mdash;to Wilmington&mdash;to
Baltimore?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span></p>
<p>“Oh, yes.”</p>

<p>“And you won’t mind staying up?”</p>

<p>Betty Berry covered her eyes.... “I never
rested in quite the same way as to-night,” she said. “It
has been happy&mdash;so happy, unexpected. I shall have
nine days at sea to think of it&mdash;to play and think of it,
moment by moment.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go with you clear through to the ship then.”</p>

<p>The clock ceased its torment.</p>

<p>“Have you plenty of money to get back&mdash;and all?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure&mdash;because I could loan you some?”</p>

<p>He told her again, but the thought held a comradeship
that gripped him. It happened that he was plentifully
supplied; though he would have walked back
rather than confess otherwise&mdash;a peculiar stupidity. The
beaming of the old porter made the moment at the steps
of the coach so fine, Morning found himself explaining:</p>

<p>“The lady is sailing from Baltimore in the morning.
I’ve decided to go clear through to the pier.”</p>

<p>This was an extraordinary thing for him to explain.</p>

<p>They sat in silence until the train moved, and they
could forget the snoring.... The coach grew
colder, and Betty unpacked a steamer rug which they
used for a lap-robe. Even the old darkey went to sleep
after Wilmington.</p>

<p>“Letters&mdash;” she said at last. “I have been thinking
about that.... There’s no way to tell where I am
to be. I won’t know until London, where I am to meet
my old master. Perhaps then I could tell you&mdash;but I
daren’t think of letters and risk disappointment....
You must wait until I write you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Morning began to count the days, and she knew what
was in his mind.</p>

<p>“That’s just it&mdash;one gets to lean on letters. One’s
letters are never one’s self. I know that extended writing
throws one out from the true idea of another. I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>shall think of to-night during the weeks.... It
seems, we forgot the world to-night. There&mdash;behind
the scenes&mdash;how wonderful.... There was no
thought about it. I just found myself in your arms&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Then I am not to write&mdash;until I hear from you?”
he asked. It had not occurred to him before that she
could have any deeper reason than an uncertain itinerary.</p>

<p>“That will be best.... Don’t you see, writing is
your work. It will make you turn your training upon
me. Something tells me the peril of that. As to-night
dimmed away&mdash;you would force the picture....
Trained as you, one writes to what he wishes one
to be, not to what one is.... You would make me
all over to suit&mdash;and when I came, there would be a
shock.... And then think if some night&mdash;very
eager and heart-thumping, I should reach a city&mdash;so
lonely and hungry for my letter&mdash;and it shouldn’t be
there.... No, to-night must do for me. I shall
go on my way playing and biding my time, until the
return steamer. Then some morning, about the first of
March, you shall hear that I am back&mdash;and that I am
waiting for my real letter&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And where did you learn all this&mdash;about a man
writing himself out of the real?” John Morning asked
wonderingly.</p>

<p>“If I were to be in one place to receive your letters,
I might not have thought of it&mdash;yet it is true....
Then, my letters are nothing. Perhaps I am a little
afraid to write to you. I think with the ’cello&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“All that seems very old and wise, beyond my kind
of thinking,” he said.</p>

<p>For a long time she was listening. It was like that
first afternoon.... What did Betty Berry hear
continually? It gave him a conception of what receptivity
meant&mdash;that quiescence of all that is common, that
abatement of the world and the worldly self, that quality
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>purely feminine. It was like a valley receiving the afternoon
sunlight. He realized vaguely at first that the
mastery of self, necessary for such listening, is the very
state of being saints pray for, and practice continually
to attain.... Perhaps, he thought, this is the way
great powers come&mdash;from such listening&mdash;the listening
of the soul; perhaps such power would come again and
again, if only the strength of it were turned into service
for men; perhaps it was a kind of prayer.... It
was all too vague for him to speak....</p>

<p>She was first to whisper that the dawn had come.</p>

<p>“I love you,” he said.</p>

<p>He saw her eyes with the daylight, as he had not
seen them since that first afternoon&mdash;gray eyes, very
deep. The same strange hush came to him from them.
And there was a soft gray lustre with the morning about
her traveling-coat; and her brown hair seemed half-transparent
against the panes. No one was yet abroad
in the coach.</p>

<p>“I don’t seem to belong at all&mdash;except that I love
you,” he whispered.</p>

<p>“Tell me&mdash;what that means&mdash;oh, please&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“When I think of what I am, and who I am, and
what I have been&mdash;and what common things I have done
in the stupidity of thinking they were good,” he explained
with a rush of words: “when I think of the
dozen turnings in my life, when little things said or done
by another have kept me from greater shame and nothingness&mdash;oh,
it doesn’t seem to me that I belong at all
to such a night as this! But when I feel myself here,
and see you, and how dear you are to me, how you wait
for my words, and what happiness this is together&mdash;then
it comes to me that I don’t belong to those other things,
but only to this&mdash;that I could never be a part of those
old thoughts and ways, if you were always near&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And I have waited a long time.... The world
has said again and again, ‘He will never come,’ but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>something deeper of me&mdash;something deeper than plays
the ’cello, kept waiting on and on. That deeper me
seemed to know all the time.”</p>

<p>Talking and listening carried them on. John Morning
had the different phases of self segregated in an
astonishing way. He spoke of himself as man can only
with a woman&mdash;making pictures of certain moments, as a
writer does. Volumes of emotion, they burned, talking
and listening, leaning upon each other’s words and
thoughts. They were one, in a very deep sense of joy
and replenishment. They touched for moments the
plane of unity in which they looked with calm upon the
parting, but the woman alone poised herself there. They
left the old darkey&mdash;a blessing in his voice and smile.
Such passages of the days’ journeys were always important
to Betty Berry.</p>

<p>Morning fell often from the heights to contemplate
the journey’s end and the dividing sea. In spite of his
words, in spite of his belief&mdash;his giving was not of her
quality of giving. His replenishment was less therefore....
They moved about the streets of Baltimore in
early morning. The baggage went on to the ship. An
hour remained. Sounds and passing people distracted
him. The woman was fresher than when he had seen
her last night, but Morning was haggard and full of
needs.... She was a continual miracle, unlike
anything that the world held&mdash;different in every word
and nestling and intonation. Much of her was the
child&mdash;yet from this <i>naive</i> sweetness, her mood would
change to a womanhood which enfolded and completed
him, so that they were as a globe together. In such instants
she brought vision to his substance; mind to his
brain, intuition to his logic, divination to his reason,
affinity to each element&mdash;enveloping him as water an
island. The touch of her hand was a kiss; and of her
kiss itself, passion was but the atmosphere; there was
earth below and sky above.... She took him to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>the state-room where she was to be, “so you will know
where I am when you think of me.”... They
heard the knock of heels on the deck above....</p>

<p>He could not think. He heard them calling for visitors
to go ashore.... He thought once it was too
late, and when he was really below on the wharf and she
above, and he realized that the wild hope of being taken
away with her, (his own will not entering, as the serpent
entered Eden,) he could hardly see her for the
blur&mdash;not of tears, but of his natural rending. Her voice
was but one of many good-byes to the shore, yet it came
to him out of the tumult of voices and whistles&mdash;as a ewe
to find her own.</p>

<p class="ph2">7</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">M</span>orning</span> heard some one nearby say that so-and-so
had not really sailed, but was just going down the
bay.... It was thus he learned that he might have
passed the forenoon with Betty Berry on the Chesapeake.
In fact, there was no reason for him not taking
the voyage.... In a quick rush of thinking, as he
stood there on the piers, all his weaknesses paraded before
him, each with its particular deformity. The sorry
pageant ended with a flourish, and he was left alone with
the throb of the unhealed wound in his side.</p>

<p>Betty Berry would not have agreed to let him take
the voyage, just for the sake of being with her. He
knew this instinctively, but perhaps it might have been
managed.... To think he had missed the chance
of the forenoon.... The liner was sliding down
the passage, already forgotten by the lower city....
Morning found himself looking into the window of a
drink-shop. Bottles and cases of wine in their dust and
straw-coats were corded in the window, which had an
English dimness and look of age. A quiet place; the
signs attested that ales were drawn from the wood and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>that many whiskeys of quality were within. Something
of attraction for the spirituous imagination was in the
sweet woody breath that reached him when he opened
the door. A series of race-horse pictures took his mind
from himself to better things.</p>

<p>These influences played merely upon the under-surfaces
of an intelligence whose thoughts followed the
steamer down the Chesapeake as certainly as the flock
of gulls.... It was that quiet time in the morning,
after the floors are washed. The day was bright, with
just a touch of cold in the air.</p>

<p>... A drink improved him generally. He examined
the string of horses again, and talked to the man
behind. The man declared it was his law not to drink
oftener than once in the half-hour, during the forenoon;
he stated that it paid to exert this self-control, as his appetite
was better and he was less liable to “slop over”
in the afternoon. Morning was then informed that oysters
were particularly good just now, and that a man with
a weak stomach could live on oysters.... There
was just one little flange of an oyster that was indigestible.
The man knew this because drink makes one dainty
about his eating, and one can tell what agrees with him
or otherwise. Furthermore, one could detach the indigestible
flange in one’s mouth before swallowing&mdash;anyone
could with practice. The man glanced frequently at the
clock.... Well, he would break over, just once,
and make up later. A half hour was sometimes a considerable
portage.... They became companionable.</p>

<p>Morning started back for New York at noon. The
particular train he caught was one of the best of its kind.
The buffet, the quality of service and patronage had a
different, an intimate appeal to-day. He sat there until
dark&mdash;in that sort of intensive thinking which seemed
very measured and effective to Morning. His chief
trend was a contemplation, of course, of the night before.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>Aspects appeared that did not obtrude at all with the
woman by him. Considering the opportunity, he had
kissed her very rarely, as he came to think of it....</p>

<p>His fellow-passengers let him alone. He reflected
that he could always get along with the lower orders of
men&mdash;with sailors, soldiers, bartenders; with the Jakes,
Jethros, and Jerries of the world. Duke Fallows had
remarked this.... Duke Fallows ... the old
Liaoyang adventure came back more clearly than it had
for months.... That <i>was</i> a big set of doings. Certainly
there was a thrill about those days, when one
stopped to think.</p>

<p>At dinner time, approaching the end of the journey,
Morning met a pronounced disinclination to stay on the
Jersey side. The little cabin on the hill was certainly not
for this condition of mind. He had to stop and think that
it was only yesterday noon when he left the cabin. A
period of time that flies rapidly, appears strangely long
when regarded from the moments of its closing. The
period of the past thirty hours since he had left the hill
was like a sea-voyage. The lights across the river had
a surprising attraction. When he realized the old steam
of alcohol, his mind glibly explained that it was merely
an episode of a sick and overwrought body; that the real
John Morning, of altruism and aspiration, was away at
sea with the love-woman, much cherished, the very soul
of him.</p>

<p>More than a half-year before he had fled to the country,
weary to nausea of men in chairs and buffets. The
animalism of it had utterly penetrated him at last; the
Conrad study was but one of many revelations. He had
hated the <i>Boabdil</i>; and hated more the processes of his
own mind when alcohol impelled. Only yesterday morning
he had hated the whole vanity of New York leisure,
with the same freshness that had characterized his first
month of cleanliness. Yet he found novelty in the present
adventure; the prevailing illusion of which was that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>he was wrong yesterday rather than now. That night
he sought his old haunts. There was a gladness about it.</p>

<p>“One mustn’t be too much alone,” he decided, “especially
if he is to write.... I must have got cocky
sitting there alone by the cabin-door.... These
fellows aren’t so bad....”</p>

<p>Presently he was telling the old story of Liaoyang.
That roused him a little and pulled upon mental fibers
still lame.... Was he to be identified always with
that?... A week later he was telling the story of
breaking away from the Russians at Liaoyang and making
the journey alone to Koupangtse. This was in a
strangely quiet bar on Eighth Avenue, in the Forties. A
peculiarity about this particular telling of the story was
that he remembered the ferryman on the Hun&mdash;the one
who had wakened the river-front as he led Eve down
to drink&mdash;the ferryman who was a leper....</p>

<p>As days passed he went down deeper than ever before.
“I must have had this coming&mdash;&mdash;” he would say,
and refused to cross the river to rest. There were moments
when he felt too unutterably dirty to go to the
cabin. One day, he kept saying, “I’m going to see this
through.” And on another day he reflected continually
(conscious of the cleverness of the thought) that this
drink passage was like the journey to Koupangtse....
Then there was the occasion when it broke upon
him suddenly that he was being avoided at the <i>Boabdil</i>.
He never went back.... One morning he joined
some sailors who had breezed in from afar. They
brought him memories and parlances; their ways were
his ways all that day, whose long drift finally brought
them to Franey’s <i>Lobelia</i>, as tough and tight a little bar
as you would ask any modern metropolis to furnish. The
sailors were down and done-for now, but Morning stood
by for the end, enjoying the place and the wide bleakness
of it.... A slumming party came in about
midnight&mdash;young men and women of richness and variety,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
trying to see bottom by looking straight down&mdash;as
if one could see through such dirty water.</p>

<p>The city’s dregs about him&mdash;a fabric of idiocy and
perversion and murder&mdash;did not look so fatuous nor
wicked to Morning’s eye, as did this perfumed company.
They thought they were seeing life, but, deeper than
brain, they knew better; their laughter and their voices
were off the key, because they were not being true to
themselves. Franey’s regulars were glad for the extra
drinks, but Morning had a fury. His shame for the
party was akin to the shame he had held for Lowenkampf
on the eve of battle long ago. He arose, short and
flaming, yet conscious even in his rage of the brilliance
of his idea.</p>

<p>“You people make me sick,” he said, lurching out.
“You’d have to be <i>slumee</i> to see how silly you look&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>They tried to detain him&mdash;to laugh at him&mdash;but one
woman knew better. Her low voice of rebuke to her
companions was a far greater rebuke to John Morning
at the door.</p>

<p>... Finally he began to wonder how long they
would keep on giving him money at the bank. He turned
up every day. No matter what he drew it was always
gone. Sometimes a holiday tricked him, and he suffered.
He watched for Sundays, after he learned....
The banking business was a hard process, because
he had to emerge; had to come right up to the
window and speak to a clean, white man&mdash;who had
known him before. It became the sole ascent of Morning’s
day&mdash;a torturing one. He washed and shaved for
it, when possible, and after a time managed frequently to
save enough to steady his nerves for the ordeal. Then
he had to write his name, and always a blue eye was
leveled at him, and he felt the dirt in his throat....
So he drifted for six weeks, and it was winter.</p>

<p>His descent was abrupt and deep. He tried to get
back, and found his will treacherous. He was prey at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>times to abominable fears. His body was unmanageable
from illness. There were times when it would have
meant death or insanity not to drink. For the first time
in his life he encountered an inertia that could not be
whipped to the point of reconstructivity. His thoughts
cloyed all fine things; his expression made them mawkish
and teary; his emotions overflowed on small matters.
Betty Berry, around whom all this brooding revolved,
hardly reached a plane worthy of interpretation. Morning’s
conception of the woman on the afternoon she came
to the Armory, or on the night-trip to Baltimore, contrasted
with this mental apparition of the sixth week:</p>

<p>“She is a professional musician, making her own way
in the world, and taking, as many a man would, the
things that please her as she passes. This is not the great
thing to her that it is to me. Other men have doubtless
interested her suddenly and rousingly, and have gone
their way.... Had she been a stranger to a man’s
sudden loving she would never have beckoned me to
the chair in the wings that night. She would never have
come to my arms&mdash;as I went to hers&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Sweat broke from him. The savage and abandoned
company of thoughts had ridden down all else, like a
troop of raiders, destroying as they went.... The
troop was gone; the shouting died away&mdash;but he was left
more lewd and low than the worst. He had defiled the
image of the woman who had given herself so eagerly.
He recalled how he had talked of understanding, how
he had praised her in his thoughts because she was brave
enough to be natural, and to act as a natural woman who
has found her own, after years of repression. The other
side of the shield was turned to torture him&mdash;the sweet,
low-leaning, human tenderness of Betty Berry, her patience,
her endless and ever-varying bestowals. She had
called his the voice of reality, and become silent before
it; had proved great enough to remain undestroyed in a
man’s world; her faith and spirit arose above centuries
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>of lineage in a man’s world&mdash;and she was Betty Berry
who knew her lover’s presence, though they were almost
strangers to each other, and opened her arms to
him....</p>

<p>It was a hell that he vividly reviewed for seven weeks,
and with no Virgil to guide. A scene or two from the
final day is enough:</p>

<p>... He had come from the bank about one in the
afternoon, and had taken a chair in the bar of the <i>Van
Antwerp</i>. He was neither limp nor sprawling, but in a
condition of queer detachment from exterior influences.
He knew that it was daylight; heard voices but no
words, and carried himself with the rigid effort of one
whose limbs are habitually flippant. Perhaps it was because
he was so very generous to the waiter that he was
allowed to close his eyes without being molested. In
any event, his consciousness betrayed him, and away he
went in the darkness of dream: The Ferryman of the
Hun was poling away at the stream and he, John Morning,
was but one of a company in passage. It was not
the Hun river this time; the sorrel Eve was not there.
Not alone the Ferryman, but all on board were lepers&mdash;he,
John Morning in the midst of them, a leper. The
old wound was witness to this.... They tried to
land at the little towns but natives came forth and drove
them away. Down, down stream they went and always
natives came forth to warn them as they neared the land....
Even when they drew in to the marshes and the
waste-places natives appeared and stoned them away....
And so they went down&mdash;to the ocean and the
storm and Morning opened his eyes.</p>

<p>Opposite, his back to the marble bar, his elbows
braced against the rail, stood Mr. Reever Kennard,
watching him, and the look upon the face of the famous
correspondent was that of scornful pity&mdash;as if there was
a truce to an old enmity, no longer worth while.</p>

<p>Still later on that day, over on Second Avenue,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>Morning almost bumped into a small yellow sign at the
elevator entrance to the Metal Workers’ Hall, to the effect
that Duke Fallows was to address a gathering there
that night.</p>

<p class="ph2">8</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">A</span> flash</span> of love came to his heart for Duke Fallows
at the sight of the name. There was nothing
maudlin about this; rather, a decent bit of stamina in
the midst of sentimental overflows. It was the actual inside
relation, having nothing to do with the old surface
irritation.... Morning took care of himself as
well as he could during the day. He meant to mix with
the crowd at the meeting, but not to make himself known
until he was free from vileness. He would keep track
of the other’s place and movements in New York. When
he was fit&mdash;there would be final restoration in the meeting.
His heart thumped in anticipation. The yellow
poster had turned the corner for him. These first
thoughts of the upward trend are interesting:</p>

<p>He meant to cross the river and build a big fire in
the cabin. There he would fight it out and cleanse the
place meanwhile, in preparation. He pictured the cabin-door
open, water on the floor, the fire burning, the smell
of soap. He would heat water, wash his blankets, put
them out in the sun; polish his kettles with water and
sand. Every detail was important, and how strangely
his mind welcomed the freshness of these simple
thoughts. The glass of the windows would flash in the
morning, and the door of oak would gleam with its oil....
Finally he would bring Duke there.</p>

<p>This was the triumph of it all. He would bring the
sick man home; tend the fire for him, go to the dairyman’s
for milk and eggs. They could call Jake and talk
to him&mdash;seeing the heart of a simple man....
They would talk and work together ... the sick
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>man looking up at the ceiling, and he, Morning, at the
machine as in the old days. Spring would come, the
big trees would break their buds and sprinkle the refuse
down&mdash;and, God, it would be green again&mdash;all this rot
ended.... So the days would pass quickly until
Betty Berry came.... Duke would be glad to hear
of her.</p>

<p>... That night Morning went in with the workers
to their Hall and sat far back. The meeting had
been arranged under socialistic auspices; seven hundred
men at least were present. Through the haze of pipe,
cigarette, and cigars, Duke Fallows came forth.</p>

<p>And this was no sick man. His knees were strong,
and there was a lightness of shoulder that did away with
the huddle of old times. His eyes shone bright under
the hanging lamp, and his laugh was as far as Asia from
scorn. There was brown upon him; his hands, when
they fell idle, were curved as if to fit a broad-ax, and
“I’m glad to be with you, men,” he said.</p>

<p>“... I have come to tell you a story&mdash;my story.
Every man has one. I never tell mine twice the same,
but some time I shall tell it just right, and then the answer
shall come.”</p>

<p>Power augmented in the silence of the smoky hall.
The gathering recognized the artist that had come down
to them, because he loved the many and belonged with
them. They gave him instinctively the rare homage of
uncritical attention. Fallows told of Liaoyang&mdash;of the
whole preparation&mdash;of the Russian singing, the generals,
the systems by which men were called to service. Always
the theme that played through this prelude was the millet
of Manchuria. He told of the great grain fields, the
feeding troop-horses, the hollows between the hills&mdash;how
the ancient Chinese city stood in a bend of the river&mdash;of
the outer fighting, the rains, the mass of men, the
Chinese.</p>

<p>This new Duke Fallows hated no man; had no scorn
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>for the Russian chiefs. His ideas of service and humanity
concerned Russia rather than Japan&mdash;and not the
imperialistic Russia, but the real spirit&mdash;the toiler, the
dreamer, the singer, the home-maker&mdash;the Russia that
was ready, perhaps as ready as any people in the world,
to put away envy, hatred, war; to cease lying to itself,
and to grasp the reality that there is something immortal
about simplicity of life and service for others. What
concerned this Russia, Fallows declared, concerned the
very soul of the western world.</p>

<p>He placed the field for the battle in a large way&mdash;the
silent, watery skies, all-receiving <i>kao-liang</i>, and the moist
earth that held the deluges. Morning choked at the picture;
the action came back again as Fallows spoke&mdash;Lowenkampf
himself&mdash;the infantry of Lowenkampf
slipping down the ledges into the grain&mdash;Luban, machine-guns,
rout&mdash;the little open place in the millet where the
Fallows part of the battle was fought.</p>

<p>“... He was a young Russian peasant. If he
came into this hall now, we would all know instinctively
that he belonged to us. He was fine to look upon that
day, coming out of the grain&mdash;earnest, glad, his heart
turned homeward. His enemy was not Japan, but Imperialism,
and defeat was upon it. This defeat meant to
him, as it did to hundreds of soldiers in that hour&mdash;the
beginning of the road home. Luban was burning with
the shame of detected cowardice. A common soldier had
commented upon it in passing. And now this young
Russian peasant met the eyes of Luban, and the two
began to speak, and I was there to listen.</p>

<p>“The peasant said that this was not his war; that he
had been forced to come; that it meant nothing to him
if Russia took Manchuria; but that it meant a very great
deal to him&mdash;this being away&mdash;because his six babies
were not being fed by the Fatherland, and his field was
not being ploughed.</p>

<p>“It was very simple. You see it all. The Fatherland<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
forced starvation upon a man’s children, while his
field remained unploughed. Only a simple man could say
it. You must be straight as a child to speak such epics.
It is what you men have thought in your hearts.</p>

<p>“Of course, Luban only knew he was an officer and
the man was not. Machine-guns were drumming in the
distance, and the grain was hot and breathless all about.
The forward ranks were terribly broken&mdash;the soldiers
streaming back past us. Luban, who opened the discussion,
was getting the worst of it, and his best reply was
murder. He handled the little automatic gun better than
the cause of the Fatherland&mdash;shot the <i>Ploughman</i>
through the breast. I thrust him back to take the falling
one in my arms....</p>

<p>“We seemed alone together. There was power upon
me. Even in the swiftness and tumult of the passing I
made the good man see that I would father his babes,
look to the ploughing of his field, and be the son of his
mother. His passing made all clear to me. His message
was straight from the heart of the world’s suffering
poor, from the heavy-laden. He spoke to kings and generals,
and to all who have and are blind. There in the
havoc of the retreat, dying in my arms&mdash;he made it vivid
as the smiting sun of Saul&mdash;that this hideous disorder
of militia was not his Fatherland. He would have fought
for the real Fatherland. He was a son in spirit, and a
state-builder; he would have fought for that; he was
not afraid to die....</p>

<p>“Love for him had come strangely to my heart, men.
I said to him&mdash;words I cannot remember now&mdash;something
I had never been able to write, because I had not
written for men before, but for some fancied elect. I
made him know that he had done well, that his field
would bring forth, and that his house would glow red
with firelight.... I think my Ploughman felt as I
did even before his heart was still&mdash;that there is something
beyond death in the love of men for one another....
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>It was wonderful. We forgot the battle.
We forgot Luban and the firing. We were one. His
spirit was upon me&mdash;and the good God gave him
peace.</p>

<p>“I tell you quietly, but don’t you see&mdash;this that I
bring so quietly is the message from the Ploughman who
passed&mdash;the message of Liaoyang? And this is the sentence
of it: Where there is a real Fatherland&mdash;there
will be Brotherhood.</p>

<p>“The world is so full of pallor and agony and sickness
and stealing. First, it is because of the Lubans.
The Lubans are sick for power&mdash;sick with their desires.
Having no self-mastery, they are lost and full of fear.
They fear the whip, they fear poverty and denial; theirs
is a continual fear of being stripped to the nakedness
of what they are&mdash;as old Mother Death strips a man. In
the terror of all these things they seek to turn the whip
upon others, to reinforce their emptiness with exterior
possessions. Because their souls are dying, and because
they feel the terror of sheer mortality, they seek to kill
the virtue in other men. Because they cannot master
themselves, they rise in passion to master others. They
could not live but for the herds.</p>

<p>“We who labor are the strength of the world. I say
to you, men, poverty is the God’s gift to His elect. It is
to us who have only ourselves to master&mdash;that the dream
of Brotherhood can come true. It is alone to us, who
have nothing, that these possessions can come, which old
Mother Death is powerless to take away. And we who
labor and are heavy-laden are making our colossal error
to-day. We are the muttering herds. Standing with the
many we may not know ourselves. We look upon the
cowardice and emptiness of the Lubans and call it Power.
We see the ways of the Herd-drivers&mdash;and dream of
driving others, instead of ourselves. We look upon the
Herd-drivers&mdash;and turn upon them the same thoughts
of envy and hatred and cruelty&mdash;which cuts them off
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>from every source of power and leaves them empty and
cowardly indeed.</p>

<p>“These are the thoughts of the herds&mdash;and yet down
in the muscling mass men are not to blame. It takes
room for a man to be himself&mdash;it takes room for a man
to love his neighbor and to master himself. Terrified,
whipped, packed, sick with the struggle and the strain of
it all&mdash;how can men, turning to one another, find brotherhood
in the eyes of their fellows. Living the life of the
laboring herds in the great cities&mdash;why, it would take
Gods to love men so!... The world is so full of
pallor and agony and sickness and stealing&mdash;first, because
of the Lubans, and, second, because of the City....
And after Liaoyang, I went straight to the
Ploughman’s house&mdash;for I had given my word. And
now I will tell you what I found on the little hill-farm
up in the Schwarenka district among the toes of the Bosk
mountains, a still country.”</p>

<p class="ph2">9</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">“I</span> remember</span> the soldiers at Liaoyang, the last
thing, the many who had grasped at the hope that
defeat meant the end of the war. They were learning
differently as I left. Hundreds gave up from the great
loneliness.... I carried the name of my Ploughman
across the brown country, and the northern autumn
was trying to hold out against the frosts. Asia is desolate.
We who are white men, and who know a bit of the
loveliness of life&mdash;even though we labor at that which
is not our life&mdash;we must grant that the Northern Chinese
have learned this: To suffer quietly.</p>

<p>“Baikal was crossed at last. On and on by train into
the West&mdash;until I came to the little village that he had
said. For days it had been like following a dream.
Sometimes it seemed to me so wonderful&mdash;that young
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>man coming out of the millet, and what he said&mdash;that I
thought it must have come to me in a vision, that I was
mad to look for his town and the actual house in the
country beyond. Yet they knew his name in the little
town, and said that early next morning I could get a
wagon to take me to the cabin, which was some <i>versts</i>
away.</p>

<p>“I had known so much of cities. For weeks I had
been in the noises of the Liaoyang fighting and in trains.
Moreover, I had been ill for a long time, too&mdash;a crawling,
deadly illness. But that night my soul breathed. I
ate black bread by candle-light and drank milk. The
sharpness of mid-October was in the air. You will
laugh when I say it seemed to me, an American, as if
I had come home. In the morning early I looked away
to the East, from whence I had come, and where the
sun was rising. (The ceiling of the little room was so
low I had to bend my head.) To the north the mountains
were sharp in the morning light and shining like
amethyst.... I left the wagon at the first sight of
the hut in the distance, and I reached there in the warmth
of the morning.</p>

<p>“An old man was sitting in the sun. He asked me to
have bread, and said they had some sausage for the
coming Sunday. This was mid-week. A child brought
good water. Then I heard the cane of the old woman,
and saw her hand first, as it thrust the cane out from
the door&mdash;all brown and palsied, the hand, its veins
raised and the knuckles twisted from the weight that bent
her fingers against the curve of the stick. The rest was
so pure. She had been a tall woman&mdash;very thin and bent
and white now. When I looked into that face I saw
the soul of the Ploughman. I can tell you I wanted to
be there. It was very strange.... I can see her
now, looking up at me, as the old do from their leaning.
It was like the purity and distance of the morning. I
trembled, too, before this old wife, for the fact in my
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>mind about her son. I tell you, old mother-birds are
wise.</p>

<p>“It was as if my garments smelled of the fighting.
She knew whence I had come; she looked into
my soul and found the death of her son. Her
soul knew it, but not her brain yet. She may have
found my love for him, too&mdash;the deep bond between
us.</p>

<p>“‘Ask the stranger to stay. We will have sausage
by the Sunday,’ said the old man. His thought was held
by hunger.</p>

<p>“‘Hush, Jan&mdash;he comes from our son&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>“‘And where are the children and the young mother?’
I asked.</p>

<p>“‘They are out for faggots in the bush&mdash;they will
come&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>“I had thought, as I traveled, (the thoughts of the
weeks on the road,) to do many things; to give them
plentifully of money; to arrange for someone to do the
late fall and winter work. I had intended to go on,
when sure that everything was at hand to make them
comfortable. I tell you, men, it was all too living for
that. One could not perform unstudied benefits for the
mother of the Ploughman. There was more than money
wanted there.</p>

<p>“‘We would like to have you stay with us,’ the
mother said, ‘but our poverty is keen, and we have not
bread enough now for the winter.... He was
taken long before the harvest, and it is long until the
grain comes again&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>“‘But if he were here&mdash;what would be done,
Mother?’</p>

<p>“‘Ah, if he came,’ she said strangely. ‘If he
came&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>“The father now spoke:</p>

<p>“‘He would cut wood for our neighbors this winter&mdash;when
the ploughing was finished. That would provide
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>food&mdash;good food. Oh, he would know what to do&mdash;our
Jan would know&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>“I won’t soon forget that high, wavering voice of
the old man&mdash;‘Oh, he would know what to do&mdash;our Jan
is a good son&mdash;&mdash;’ and the shake of his head.</p>

<p>“‘But may I not do some of the things that he
would do?’</p>

<p>“I had to say it twice, for I spoke their language
poorly. I had understood the son at Liaoyang&mdash;but all
moments were not like those in which he spoke to me.</p>

<p>“‘And then,’ I added hastily, ‘he sent you some
money&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>“I dared not offer much with that pure old face looking
at me. The silver and gold that was in my purse
I put in her lap.</p>

<p>“‘Oh, it is very much&mdash;the good God brought you
from him, did he not?’</p>

<p>“‘And we will not need to wait until Sunday for&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>“‘Hush&mdash;Jan&mdash;no, we will not need to wait.’</p>

<p>“... And then the young mother came. I saw
her steps quicken when yet she was far off. The little
ones were about her&mdash;all carrying something. The older
children were laughing a little, but the others were quiet
in their haste and effort to keep up.... There was
one little boy, but I will tell you afterward of the littlest
Jan.... There was a pallor over the brood. Their
health was pure, and their blood strong, but that pallor
had come. Men, it was hunger already. Here were the
fields, and the Fatherland had taken him before the harvest.
This thing, the shocking truth of it; that this actually
could be; that a country could do such a thing&mdash;made
me forget everything else for the moment. Then
I realized that I must keep the truth from the young
mother. Before I spoke at all they told her that I had
come from her husband.</p>

<p>“Her lips were white, her breasts wasted. She was
lean from hunger, lean from her bearing. Young she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>was for the six, but much had she labored, and there
was a mountain wildness in her eyes. She was stilled,
as the old mother had been, by the fear of hearing
her man’s death. She dared not ask. She accepted what
was said&mdash;that I had come from him, that I had brought
money, and wished to stay for a little.... She
leaned against the door, the smaller children gathering
at her knees, the others putting away the wood. Her
single skirt hung square, and her arms seemed very
long, nearly to her knees; her hands loose and tired.
Her hair was yellow; the wind had tossed it. You know
how a horse that has been listening, suddenly catches his
breath again. The same sound came from her as she
started to breathe again.... One of the smaller
children laughed, and I looked down. It was the little
four-year-old, the third Jan of that house, and he was
close to my knees, looking up at me ... and we
were all together.</p>

<p>“I loved the world better after that look of the child
into my eyes.... I took him on my shoulder. We
went to the village together. That night the wagon
brought us back; there was much food.... And
that was my house. I looked out on the mountains the
next day, and for many days to come, and, men&mdash;their
grand sky-wide simplicity poured into my heart. I took
the old horse out, and we ploughed during the few days
remaining. There was not much land&mdash;but we ploughed
it together to the end, when the frost made the upturned
clods ring. Then I strawed up the shed for the old horse
to pass his winter in warmth, and brought blankets for
him. I respected that old horse. Health and good-fellowship
had come to me as we worked together. I
remember the sharp turning of the early afternoons from
yellow to gray and to dark.... Then we went into
the bush together in the early winter days. The ax rang,
and the snow-bolt was piled high each day with wood.
The smell of the wood-smoke in the morning air had a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>zest for my nostrils I had never known before, and at
night the cabin windows were red with fire-light. We
were all one together. And I think the spirit of the
Ploughman was there in the happiness.</p>

<p>“Sometimes in the night when I would get up to replenish
the fire&mdash;the mystery of plain goodness would
come to me. I would see the children and others all
around. Then at the frosty window, shading the fire
from my eyes, I looked out upon the snows. I was unable
to contain the simple grandeurs that had unfolded
to me day by day.... And then I would go back
to the blankets where the little boy lay&mdash;his hand always
fumbling for me as I crept in. The love that I felt
for this child was beyond all fear. We could stand together
against any fate. And one night it came to me
that from much loving of one a man learns to love the
many, and that I would really be a man when I learned
to love the world with the same patience and passion
that I loved the little boy. The Ploughman came along
in a dream that night and said it was all quite true.</p>

<p>“And that was the winter.... I wish you could
have seen this sick man who had come. I had lain on
my back for months, except when some great effort
aroused me. I had that coming on, men, which makes a
man walk&mdash;as a circus bear turns and totters on his
back feet. The house, the field, the plough, the horse,
woods, winter, and mountains, love for the child, love for
all the others&mdash;the much that my hands found to do and
the heart found to give&mdash;these things made me new
again. These simple sound and holy things.</p>

<p>“I had been a sick man mentally and morally, too,
sick with ego and intellect&mdash;a nasty sickness. But one
could not look, feeling the joy in which I lived, upon the
snows of the foothills, nor afar through the yellow winter
noons to the gilded summits of the Bosks; one could
not look into the eyes of the children, the last vestige of
hunger pallor gone from them; one could not talk of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>tobacco-and-sausage with the old man by his fireside; nor
watch the mysterious great givings of the two mothers&mdash;their
whole lives giving&mdash;pure instruments of giving&mdash;passionate
givers, they were; givers of life and preservers
of life&mdash;I say, men, one could not live in this purity
and not put away such evil and cruel things....
As the sickness of the blood went from me&mdash;so that
sickness of mind.... And, I tell you, we were ready
as a house could be, when the news came officially that
our Ploughman was among the missing from the battle
of Liaoyang.</p>

<p>“It was sharper than any winter night. We stood in
the cabin and wept together. Then in the hush&mdash;the
real thought of it all came to one&mdash;to whom, do you
think?... She was on her knees&mdash;<i>the old mother</i>&mdash;praying
for the other peasant cabins in Russia&mdash;the
thousands of others from which a son and husband was
gone&mdash;‘cabins to which the good God has not sent such a
friend.’... I tell you, men, all the evil of past
days seemed washed from me in that hour....
And that is my home. (The old horse and I opened the
fields again in the springtime.)</p>

<p>“After that I went down to Petersburg to tell my
story, and to Moscow. I have told it in cellars and
stables&mdash;in Berlin, in Paris, and London. I am making
the great circle&mdash;to tell it here&mdash;and on, when we are
finished, to Chicago, to Denver and San Francisco&mdash;and
then the long sail homeward, following the first journey
to the foothills of the Bosk range. I will go to my old
mother there, and to the little boy, who looked up into
my eyes&mdash;as if we were born to play and talk and sleep
together.</p>

<p>“The days of the conscript gangs are over here, men.
Such days are numbered, even in Russia. They don’t
come to your door in this country and take you away
from your work to fight across the world&mdash;but the Lubans
are here&mdash;and the cities are full of horror. It is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>in the cities where the herds are, where the little Lubans
whip, and the bigger Lubans thrive. In the pressure
and heaviness of the cities&mdash;the thought that comes to the
herd is the old hideous conception of the multitude&mdash;that
the way of the Lubans is the way of life....
It isn’t the way. The way of life has nothing to do
with greed, nor with envy, nor with schemes against the
bread of other men. It is a way of peace and affiliation&mdash;of
standing together. And you who have little
can go that way; you who labor can go that way&mdash;because
you are the strength of the world. Don’t resist
your enemies, men&mdash;leave them. The Master of us all
told us that. And when the herds break, and this modern
hell of the city is diminished&mdash;the Lubans will follow
you out&mdash;whining and bereft, they will follow you out,
as the lepers of Peking follow the caravans to the gates
and beyond.... I have told you of my home&mdash;the
little cabin that came to me from the beginnings of
compassion. And there is such a home for every man
of you&mdash;in the still countries where the voice of God
may be heard.”</p>

<p>Morning, desperately ill, rose to leave the hall. In
the momentary hush, as he reached the door, the voice
of Duke Fallows was raised again, calling his name.</p>

<p class="ph2">10</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">“J</span>ohn</span>&mdash;&mdash;” a second time.</p>

<p>Morning turned, his arms lifted despairingly.</p>

<p>“Wait, John, I’ll join you!”</p>

<p>Fallows came down.... The man who gently
held the door shut smiled with strange kindness. There
was a shining of kindness in men’s faces....
Morning did not feel that he belonged. He was broken
and shamed.... The big man was upon him&mdash;the
long arms tossed about him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span></p>

<p>“I’ve been looking and listening for you too long,
John, to let you go.”</p>

<p>“... I just wanted to hear you. I’m shot to pieces,
Duke; I’ll get a few drinks and wait for you. Then,
you’ll see, I’m all out of range of the man you are&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>There was no answer. Morning looked up to find
the long bronzed face laughing, the eye gleaming. Fallows
turned to the doorman and another, saying:</p>

<p>“Both of you go with him. He needs a drink or two,
and one of you come back to show me the way to him&mdash;when
I’m through here.... This is a great night
for us, John.”</p>

<p>The three went down in the elevator.... And so
the sick man had not come back&mdash;the dithyrambic Duke
Fallows was gone for good. The sick man was strong;
the impassioned phrase-maker had risen to the simple
testimony of service. From scorn and emotion, from
judgment and selection, he had risen to the plane of loving
kindness.... The air in the street refreshed
him a little. Morning found a bar.</p>

<p>“I’ve been drinking,” he said to the men. “Fallows
is a king. I was there with him at Liaoyang....
Maybe you saw my story in the <i>World-News</i>....
He stayed in the grain with Luban. I went on to see the
cavalry fight.... I came back home to do the story.
He went on to Russia on the <i>Ploughman</i> story&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Is he a preacher?” said one of the men.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;but he learned about war and women first.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take a soft drink and go back. You stay here,
and I’ll bring him to you,” the same one went on.</p>

<p>The other drank with Morning and agreed that they
would not leave until Fallows came.</p>

<p>“And so he learned about war and women first,” he
said queerly, when they were alone. “But he has been a
laboring man&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes. You heard him.”</p>

<p>“But before that farm in Russia&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, yes; he was a laborer.”</p>

<p>“Well, he certainly got the crowd with him,” the man
acknowledged.</p>

<p>“You know why, don’t you?” Morning said impressively.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“He’s <i>for</i> the crowd. People feel it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I knew that.”</p>

<p>There was quiet, and then the face turned to Morning:</p>

<p>“Say, how did you get such a start as this? This
kind means weeks&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It got away from me before I knew it. I must
have got to gambling with myself to see how far I
could go.”</p>

<p>“Are you going to quit?”</p>

<p>A mist filled Morning’s mind. The question seemed
an infringement. Then it occurred to him how he had
fallen to lying to himself.</p>

<p>“He’ll make you quit, but don’t let him stop you too
short. You’d be a wreck in a few hours. You see how
you needed these two or three drinks?”</p>

<p>... Fallows entered with several of the committee.
He had promised to speak to them again.</p>

<p>“It’s what I came for,” he was saying. “So long as I
am wanted I’ll stay.... Yes, I’m a socialist....
Yes, I believe in fighting, but when our kind of
men stand together, there won’t be anything big enough
to give us a fight. When our kind of men look into one
another’s eyes and find service instead of covetousness&mdash;there’s
nothing in the world to stand against us.”</p>

<p>Fallows and Morning were in a steam-room together
two hours afterward. Morning was limp and light-headed.
He had told of some of the things that had
happened since Baltimore&mdash;of men he had met&mdash;of the
slummers&mdash;of harrowing nights and waiting for the bank
to open.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span></p>

<p>“You had to have it, John?”</p>

<p>There was something in the way Fallows spoke the
word, <i>John</i>, that made Morning weaker and filled his
throat. He had to speak loudly for the hissing of the
steam.</p>

<p>“Why, if you didn’t get humble and stay humble after
such a training&mdash;you’d be the poorest human experiment
ever undertaken by the Master. But you can’t fail.
It isn’t in the cards to fail. You’ve ridden several
monsters&mdash;Drink, Ambition, Literature&mdash;but they won’t
get you down. Why, even the sorrel mare didn’t kill
you, as I promised aforetime. I saw a lot in that story.
You loved her to the last. You left her dead and hunched
on an alien road. You’ve loved these others long enough.
You’ll leave them dead&mdash;even that big fame stuff. I
think you’ve ridden that pompous fool to death already.
They are all passages on the way to Initiation. Your
training for service is a veritable inspiration&mdash;and you’ll
write to men&mdash;down among men. I love that idea&mdash;you’ll
write the story of Compassion&mdash;down among men&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Fallows’ face came closer through the steam. He
scrutinized the wound that wouldn’t heal. “Did you ever
hear about Saint Paul’s thorn in the flesh?...
‘And lest I be exalted above measure through the abundance
of revelations, there was given me a thorn in the
flesh&mdash;?’ It all works out. You’ll have to excuse me.
The Bible was the only book I had with me up in the
Bosk country. I found it all I wanted. I would take
it again.... Yes, John, it’s all right with you.”</p>

<p>Morning was telling of that afternoon at the Armory.
He passed over quickly the period of worldly achievement
in New York to the quiet blessedness he had hit
upon, finding the hill and the elms.</p>

<p>“That’s the formula&mdash;to get alone and listen&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That’s what you preached to-night, wasn’t it?”...
Presently he was back to Betty Berry again&mdash;finding
her at the ’cello&mdash;the wonderful ride to Baltimore&mdash;which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
brought him to the drink chapter once
more.... He couldn’t see Duke’s face as he spoke
of the woman. There was a peculiar need of the other
saying something when he had finished. This only was
offered:</p>

<p>“We won’t talk about that now, John....
You’d better take another little drink. Your voice is
down.... You’ll be through after a day or two,
and I’ll stay with you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“We’ll go over to the cabin to-morrow,” said Morning.</p>

<p>They were lying cot by cot in the cooling-room, and
the talk for a time concerned Lowenkampf, his court-martial
and discharge.</p>

<p>“Do you know how I thought of you coming back,
Duke?” Morning whispered afterward.</p>

<p>“Tell me.”</p>

<p>“I always thought of you coming back a sick man&mdash;staring
at the ceiling as you used to&mdash;sometimes talking
to me, sometimes listening to what I had written. But
the main thought was how I would like to take care of
you. I was rotten before. I wanted you sick, so I could
show you better.”</p>

<p>The huge hand stretched across from cot to cot.</p>

<p>“It was afterward&mdash;that all the things you said in
Liaoyang came back to me right.... We were lying
in ’Frisco waiting for quarantine, and my stuff was
finished the second time, before I read your letter to me
and the one to Noyes&mdash;and the Ploughman story. That
was the first time I really saw it right. There was a
little doctor with me&mdash;Nevin&mdash;who got it all from the
first reading. At Liaoyang we were down too low
among the fighting to get it. That Ploughman story
made my big yarn look like a death-mask of the campaign.
Betty Berry got it too.... It was the same
to-night&mdash;why, you got those men, body and soul.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to think so, John; but I’m afraid you’re
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>wrong. It was just a seed to-night. Men need to be cultivated
every day in a thousand ways.... Women
get things quicker; they can listen better.... The
last night before Jesus was taken by the Roman soldiers,
he told the Eleven that he could be sure only of them.
He knew that of the multitude that heard him&mdash;most
would sink back. He counted on just the Eleven, and
built his church on the weakest, upon the most unstable&mdash;counting
only on the strength of the weakest link....
The fact is, John, I’m only counting on you.
I’ve got to count on you.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Less than five weeks had elapsed, and yet the worst
seemed as far back, in some of Morning’s moments, as
the deck-passage out of China. He had suffered abominably.
Fallows stood by night and day at first. He
brought back a certain quality from the Russian farm
that was pure inspiration to the other. They spoke
about the Play. Morning was more than ever glad that
Markheim had refused it. They sat long by the fire.
More happened than modern America would believe off-hand&mdash;for
John Morning began to learn to listen. Fallows
was happy. His presence in the room was like the
fire-light. Twice more he went across to the Metal
Workers’ Hall, and still the New York group would not
let him go. The Socialists brought him their ideas. He
was in the heart of threatening upheavals. He reiterated
that they must be united in one thing first; they must
have faith in one another. They must not answer greed
with greed. They must be sure of themselves; they
must have a pure voice; they must know first what was
wanted, and follow the vision.... Duke Fallows
knew that it was all the matter of a leader.... He
told them of the men and women in Russia who have put
off self. Finally Duke appeared to see that his work was
done, and he retired from them.</p>

<p>“It is delicate business,” he said to Morning. “There’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>fine stuff in the crowd&mdash;then there’s the rest. If I should
show common just once&mdash;all my work would be spoiled,
and even the blessed few would forget the punch of my
little story. They think I’ve gone on west.”</p>

<p>Still he didn’t leave the cabin on the hill.</p>

<p>It was only when Morning undertook to touch upon
the love story&mdash;that Fallows looked away....
Morning tried to comprehend this. Something had happened.
The big man who had stared at so many ceilings
of Asia, breaking out from time to time in strange utterances
all colored with desire; the man who had met
his Eve, and talked of being controlled by her even
after death&mdash;shuddered now at the mention of Betty
Berry.... Morning even had a suspicion at last
that the other construed a relation between the woman’s
influence and the excess of alcohol. These moments dismayed
him.</p>

<p>There is a dark spot in every man’s radiance&mdash;and
this was the Californian’s, Morning concluded. In the
transformation which the journey to Russia had effected,
his particular weakness seemed hardened into a crust of
exceptional austerity. The only women he ever spoke
of in the remotest personal fashion belonged to the peasant
family of the Ploughman. His audiences were unmixed
by his own arrangement. In tearing out his central
weakness, a certain madness on the subject had
rushed in, a hatred that knew no quarter, and a zeal in
denial that only one who has touched the rim of ruin
can know.</p>

<p>On the last night of February they talked and read
late. The reading was from Saint Paul in the different
letters. Fallows seemed impassioned with the figure.</p>

<p>“I understand him,” he said.</p>

<p>“He was afraid of women. Sometimes he seems
to hate women,” Morning remarked. Certain lines of
Paul’s on the subject had broken the perfection of the
message for him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span></p>

<p>A strange look came to Fallows. The finger that
was turning a page drew in with the others, and the
hand that rested upon the book was clenched....
“Paul knew women,” he muttered.</p>

<p>“You think before he took that road to Damascus&mdash;he
knew women?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Even the Paul who stood by holding the garments
of the stoners of Stephen?”</p>

<p>“He was a boy then. He learned afterward, I think.”</p>

<p>“He couldn’t have known the saints among them,”
said Morning, who was smiling in his heart.</p>

<p>“Perhaps some saint among them was the one who
made him afraid. You know women won’t have men
going alone&mdash;not even the saints among women....
There may have been one who refused to be dimmed
altogether even by that great light.”</p>

<p>“But he went alone&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“In that way she wouldn’t be the Thorn,” Fallows
said slowly. “She would be greater power for him.
Yes, Saint Paul went alone. We wouldn’t be reading
him to-night&mdash;had he turned back to her.”</p>

<p>That hurt. Morning was no longer smiling within.
“I didn’t learn women&mdash;even as a boy,” he said.</p>

<p>Fallows was unable to speak. He had never loved
Morning as at this moment. He was tender enough to
catch the strange pathos of it, which the younger man
could not feel.</p>

<p>“You’re a natural drunkard, John,” he said presently.
“You are by nature ambitious, as it is intimated Cæsar
was; but you are naturally a monk, too. I say it with
awe.”</p>

<p>“You are wrong,” Morning said with strength.
“When this woman came into the room at the Armory
that first day&mdash;it was as if she brought with her the better
part of myself&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You said that same before. You were sick. You
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>were torn by exhaustion and by that letter of mine about
Reever Kennard. It was the peace and mystery a woman
always brings to a sick man.... <i>Your</i> woman is
your genius, John. Any rival will stifle and defame it.
It’s the woman in a man that makes him a prophet or a
great artist. Your ego is masculine; your soul is feminine.
When you learn to keep the ego out of the brain,
and use the soul, you will become an instrument, more
or less perfect, for eternal utterances. When you achieve
the union of the man and woman in you&mdash;that will be
your illumination. You will have emerged into the
larger consciousness. You are not so far as you think
from that high noon-light. If you should take a woman
in the human way, you will not achieve in this life the
higher marriage, of which the union of two is but a symbol.
That would be turning back, with the spiritual
glory in your eyes&mdash;back to the shadow of flesh.”</p>

<p>“How do you know that?” Morning asked coldly.</p>

<p>“Because of the invisible restraints that have kept
you from women so far.... I believe you are prepared
to tell men something about the devils of drink and
ambition&mdash;having met them?”</p>

<p>“It is possible.”</p>

<p>“I speak with the same authority.”</p>

<p>Morning did not accept this authority, but was long
disturbed after the light was out.... Her ship had
been six days at sea.</p>

<p>They opened the door wide to the first morning of
March. Snow was upon the hill, but there was a promise
in the air, even in the sharpness of it. The wind
came in, searched among the papers of the table, disordered
the draughts of the chimney, filling the room
with a faint flavor of wood-smoke, that perfect incense.
They stood there, testing the day, and each was thinking
of the things of the night before. Fallows said:</p>

<p>“John, you didn’t build this cabin with the idea of a
woman coming?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span></p>

<p>“No; it was built before I found her the second time.
It was my escape from <i>Boabdil</i>.... But I thought
of her coming, many times afterward&mdash;just as I thought
of you coming back to stare at the rafters&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Fallows looked down intently at him for a moment,
and said:</p>

<p>“John, you’ve got about all your equipment now.
You can’t stand much more tearing down. My road is
not for you. You were given balance against that.
Don’t venture into what is alien ground for you. You
will get back your health. Even the wound will heal.
Then will come to you those gracious ideals of singleness,
plainness of house and fare, of purity and solitude
and the integration of the greater dimension of force....
You are through looking&mdash;you must listen now.
The blessedness you told me of this last summer was
but a breath of what you will get....</p>

<p>“You are a natural monk. If you were in a monastery,
the laws restraining you would be gross and material,
compared with those bonds which nature has put
upon you. The cowl, the cell, and the solitude are but
symbols again of the inner monasticism a few rare souls
have known. You need no exterior bonds, vows, nor
threatenings&mdash;no walls, no brandishing threats of damnation.
But, if you should betray the invisible restraints
that have held you for so many years, the sin would
be far deadlier than breaking any vows made to a church
or to an order. Vows are for half-men, John; vows are
but the crutches of an unfinished integrity.”</p>

<p class="ph2">11</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">O</span>n</span> the morning of the Third, at ten, her call came to
him. Shortly after twelve he was across the river
and far uptown in the hallway of an apartment-house.
Even as he spoke her name, his was called from the head
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>of the stairs. He always remembered the intonation....
A fire was burning in the grate. The ’cello was
there. She left the hall-door of the room open, but they
heard voices, and it was draughty.... She went to
close it and returned to Morning, who was still standing.</p>

<p>“What is the matter? You are not well,” she said....
It was hard for him to realize that this was
only the third time he had seen her. He was trying to
adjust her in the other meetings with this&mdash;the angel
who had come helping to the Armory; the concert Betty
Berry, her nature flung wide to expression, bringing her
gift with love to her people. The Armory was one;
but the Betty Berry of the concert-night was many: she
who had come forth from the stage to his arms (and
that was the kiss of all time); the listening Betty Berry
in the dimness of the Pullman car; holding fast to his
hand as a child might, while they watched the dawn
of morning together; the Betty Berry who had led him
to her berth on the ship&mdash;that kiss and this....</p>

<p>The room had disordered him at the first moment. It
was so particularly a New York apartment room. But
the ’cello helped it; the grate-fire was good, and after
she had shut the door&mdash;there was something eternal about
the sweetness of that&mdash;it was quite the place for them
to be.</p>

<p>He was animate with emotions&mdash;and yet they were
defined, sharp, of their own natures, no soft overflow
of sentiment, each with a fineness of its own, like breaths
of forest and sea and meadow lands. These were great
things which came to him; but they were not passions....
He saw her with fear, too. Simply being
here, had the impressiveness of a miracle. It was less
that he did not deserve to be with her, than that the
world he knew was hardly the place for such blessedness.
He was listening to her, in gladness and humility:</p>

<p>“... I asked myself again and again after you
were gone, ‘Is it a dream?’ ... I moved about the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>decks waiting for the night, as one in a deep dream....
You were gone so quickly after that voice. Oh,
I was all right. I was full of you. It would have seemed
sacrilege to ask for you again.... Yet I seemed to
expect you with every knock or step or bell. They asked
me to play on shipboard, and I could hardly believe you
were not among those who listened.... That first
night at sea, the moon was under a hazy mass. I don’t
know why I speak of it, but I remember how I stood
watching it&mdash;perhaps hours&mdash;and out of it all I only
realized at last that my hands were so small for the
things I wanted to do for you, and for everybody.”</p>

<p>That was the quality of her&mdash;as if between every
sentence, hours of exterior influences had intervened....
He began to realize that Betty Berry never explained.
All that afternoon, in different ways, his comprehension
augmented on how fine a thing this is. She
was glad always to abide by what she said or did. Even
on that night, when she came from her playing to the
wings where he stood, came to his arms, while the people
praised her&mdash;she never made light of that acceptance.
Many would have diminished it, by saying that
they were not accountable in the excitement and enthusiasm
of a sympathetic audience. It was so to-day when
the door was closed. It seemed to Morning as if human
adults should be as fine as this&mdash;above all guile and fear.</p>

<p>He was in a risen world that afternoon. Often he
wished he could make the world see her as he did. But
that was the literary habit, and a tribute to her. Certainly
it was not for the writing. He was clay beside
her, but happy to be clay.... She did not know it,
he thought, but she was free.</p>

<p>That was his thought of the day. Betty Berry was
free. The door of the cage was open for her. She did
not have to stay, but she did stay for love of the weaker-winged.</p>

<p>“Will all our meetings be so different and lovely?”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>she asked in the early dusk. “Please tell me about yourself
very long ago&mdash;the little boy, before he went away.”</p>

<p>It was queer for her to ask that. He had expected
her to inquire at once about the three months since their
parting in Baltimore. He had determined to tell if she
asked, but it was hard even to think of his descents, with
her sitting by the fire so near. Such things seemed to
have nothing to do with him now&mdash;especially when he
was with her. They were like old and vile garments cast
off; and without relation to him, unless he went back and
put them on again. Little matters like Charley and his
sister had a relation, for they were without taint. His
thoughts to-day were thoughts of doing well for men, as
in fine moments with Duke Fallows&mdash;of going out <i>with
her</i> into the world to help&mdash;of writing and giving, of
laughing and lifting.... It was surprising how
he remembered the very long ago days&mdash;the silent, solid,
steadily-resisting little chap. Many things came back,
and with a clearness that he had not known for years.
The very palms of her hands were upturned in her
listening; it seemed as if the valves of her heart must be
open.</p>

<p>“I can see him&mdash;the dear little boy&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He laughed at her tenderness.... They went
out late to dinner; and by the time he had walked back
to the house it was necessary for him to leave, if he
caught the last car to Hackensack. Duke Fallows would
be expecting him at the cabin....</p>

<p>It came to him suddenly, and with a new force, on
the ferry, that he had once wished she were pretty. He
suffered for it again. He could never recall her face
exactly. She came to him in countless ways&mdash;with poise
for his restlessness, with faith and stamina that made
all his former endurings common&mdash;but never in fixed
feature. It was the same with her sayings. He remembered
the spirit and the lustre of them, but never the
words.... She was a saint moving unobserved
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>about the world, playing&mdash;adrift on the world, and so
pure.</p>

<p>He realized also that he had spoken of Betty Berry
for the last time to Duke Fallows. There was no doubt
in his mind now that Fallows had replaced his old weakness
with what might be called, in kindness&mdash;fanaticism....
The thought was unspeakable that Betty Berry
could spoil his work in the world&mdash;he, John Morning,
a living hatch of scars from his errors ... and
so arrogant and imperious he had been in evil-doing!
This trend made him think of her first words to-day:
“You are not well.” It was true that he had been astonished
often of late by a series of physical disturbances,
so much so that he had begun to ask himself,
in his detached fashion, what would come next.
He could not accept Fallows’ promise that he would
get altogether right in health again. He was certainly
not so good as he had been. These things made him
ashamed.</p>

<p>Now that he was away from her, the sense obtained
that he had not been square in withholding the facts
of the wastrel period. It didn’t seem quite the same
now, as when she was sitting opposite. He would have
to tell her some time, and of that certain mental treachery
to her, and of the wound, too.... He saw
the light of the hill cabin. A touch of the old irritation
of Liaoyang had recurred of late. Morning could master
it better now. Still so many things that Fallows had
said in Asia had come true. Climbing up the hill, he
laughed uneasily at the idea of his being temperamentally
a monk.... He had not strayed much among
women; he had been too busy. Now he had met his
own. He would go to her to-morrow. His love for her
was the one right thing in the world. Fallows nor the
world could alter that....</p>

<p>The resistance which these thoughts had built in his
mind was all smoothed away by the spontaneous affection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
of the greeting. They sat down together before
the fire, but neither spoke of the woman who had come
between.</p>

<p class="ph2">12</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">O</span>n</span> the way to Betty Berry the second day, Morning
could not quite hold the altitude of yesterday.
There was much of the boy left in the manner of his love
for her. The woman that the world saw, and which he saw
with physical eyes, was only one of her mysteries. The
important thing was that he saw her really, and as she
was not seen by another.... They had been together
an hour when this was said:</p>

<p>“There comes a time&mdash;a certain day&mdash;when a little
girl realizes what beauty is, and something of what it
means in the world. That day came to me and it was
hard. I fought it out all at once. I was not exactly sure
what I wanted, but I knew that beauty could never help
me in any way. I learned to play better when I realized
this fully. I have said to myself a million times, ‘Expect
nothing. No one will love you. You must do without
that,’ I believed it firmly.... So you see when
I went back to the Armory that next morning I had
something to fall back upon.... I would not have
thought about it except you made me forget&mdash;that afternoon.
Why, I forget it now when you come; but when
you go, I force myself to remember&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Why do you do that?”</p>

<p>She was looking into the fire. The day was stormy,
and they were glad to be kept in.</p>

<p>“Why do you do that?” he repeated.</p>

<p>“Because I can’t feel quite at rest about our being
together always. It seems too wonderful. You must
understand&mdash;it’s only because it is so dear a thing&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>She had spoken hastily, seeing the fear and rebellion
in his eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span></p>

<p>“Betty Berry.... We’re not afraid of being
poor. Why not go out and get married to-day&mdash;now?”</p>

<p>Her hand went out to him.</p>

<p>“That wouldn’t be fine in us,” she said intensely. “I
would feel that we couldn’t be trusted&mdash;if we did anything
like that.... Oh, that would never keep us
together&mdash;<i>that</i> is not the great thing. And to-day&mdash;what
a gray day and bleak. We shall know if that day
comes. It will be one such as the butterfly chooses for
her emerging. It must not be planned. Such a day
comes of itself.... Why, it would be like seizing
something precious from another’s hand&mdash;before it is
offered&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And you think you are not beautiful?” he said.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>He tried to tell her how she seemed to him when
they were apart&mdash;how differently and perfectly the
phases of her came.</p>

<p>“It makes me silent,” he went on. “I try to tell just
where it is. And sometimes when I am away&mdash;I wonder
what is so changed and cleansed and buoyant in my
heart&mdash;and then I know it is you&mdash;sustaining.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t seem to belong to me&mdash;what you say,”
she answered. “I don’t dare to think of it as mine....
Please don’t think of me as above other women.
I am not apart nor above. I am just Betty Berry, who
comes and goes and plays&mdash;dull in so many ways&mdash;as yet,
a little afraid to be happy. When you tempt me as now
to be happy&mdash;it seems I must go and find someone very
miserable and do something perfect for him....
But, it is true, I fear nothing so much as that you should
believe me more than I am.”</p>

<p>A little afterward she was saying in her queer, unjointed
way, as if she spoke only here and there a sentence
from the thoughts running swiftly through her
mind:</p>

<p>“... And once, (it was only a few weeks after
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>the Armory, and I was playing eastward) I heard your
name mentioned among some musicians. They had been
talking about your war, and they had seen the great
story.... I couldn’t tell them that I know you?...
It was known you were in New York, and one
of the musicians spoke of an early Broadway engagement&mdash;of
starting for New York that very night. It was
the most common thing to say&mdash;but I went to my room
and cried. Going to New York&mdash;where you were. Can
you understand&mdash;that it didn’t seem right for him, just
to take a train like that? And I had to go eastward so
slowly. For a while after that, traveling out there, I
couldn’t hold you so clearly; but as we neared New York&mdash;whether
I wished it or not&mdash;I began to feel you again,
to expect you at every turning. Sometimes as I played&mdash;it
was uncanny, the sense that came to me, that you
were in the audience, and that we were working together....
And then you came.”</p>

<p>Her picture changed now. Morning grew restless.
It was almost as if there were a suggestion from Duke
Fallows in her sentences:</p>

<p>“I thought of you always as alone.... You
have gone so many ways alone. Perhaps the thought
came from your work. I never could read the places
where you suffered so&mdash;but I mean from the tone and
theme of it. You were down among the terrors and
miseries&mdash;but always alone.... You will go back
to them&mdash;alone, but carrying calmness and cheer. You
will be different.... It’s hard for me to say, but
if we should clutch at something for ourselves&mdash;greedily
because we want something now&mdash;and you should not be
able to do your work so well because of me&mdash;I think&mdash;I
think I should never cease to suffer.”</p>

<p>A dozen things to say had risen with hostility in his
mind to check this faltering expression, the purport of
which he knew so well in its every aspect. He hated the
thought of others seeing his future and not considering
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>him. He hated the fear that came to him. There had
been fruits to all that Fallows had said before. He had
plucked them afterward. And now Betty Berry was one
with Fallows in this hideous and solitary conception of
him. And there she sat, lovely and actual&mdash;the very
essence of all the good that he might do. He was so
tired of what she meant; and it was all so huge and unbreakable,
that he grew calm before he spoke, from the
very inexorability of it.</p>

<p>“There is no place for me to go&mdash;that you could not
go with me. Every one seems to see great service for
me, but I see it with you. Surely we could go together
to people who suffer.... I have been much alone,
but I spent most of the time serving myself. I have
slaved for myself. If Duke Fallows had left me alone,
I should have been greedy and ambitious and common.
I see you now identified with all the good of the future.
You came bringing the good with you to the Armory
that day, but I was so clouded with hatred and self-serving,
that I really didn’t know it until afterward....
All the dreams of being real and fine, of doing
good in work, and with hands and thoughts, of sometime
really being a good man who knows no happiness
but service for others&mdash;that means you&mdash;you! You must
come with me. We will be good together. We will serve
together. Everybody will be better for us. We
will do it because we love so much&mdash;and can’t help
it&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t say any more&mdash;please&mdash;please! It is too
much for me. Go away&mdash;won’t you?”</p>

<p>She had risen and clung to him, her face imploring.</p>

<p>“Do you really want me to go away?” he said.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;I have prayed for one to come saying such
things&mdash;of two going forth to help&mdash;prayed without
faith.... I cannot bear another word to be
said to-day.... I want to sit here and live
with it&mdash;&mdash;”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span></p>
<p>He was bewildered. He bent to kiss her brow&mdash;but
refrained.... Her face shone; her eyes were filled
with tears.... He was in the street trying to recall
what he had said.</p>

<p class="ph2">13</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">H</span>e</span> did not cross the river, but wandered about the
city.... She had starved her heart always,
put away the idea of a lover, and sought to carry out her
dreams of service alone. Then he had come. In the
midst of mental tossing and disorder to-day, he had
stumbled upon an expression of her highest idea of
earth-life: for man and woman to serve together&mdash;God
loving the world through their everyday lives....
And she had been unable to bear him longer near her.
It was the same with her heart, as with one who has
starved the body, and must begin with morsels.</p>

<p>He was in the hotel writing-room&mdash;filling pages to
her. He did not mean to send the pages. It was to
pass the time until evening. He lacked even the beginnings
of strength to stay away from her until to-morrow.
He would have telephoned, but she had not given him
the number, or the name of the woman who kept the
house. The writing held his thoughts from the momentarily
recurring impulse to go back. The city was
just a vibration. Moments of the writing brought her
magically near. In spite of her prayer for him not to,
his whole nature idealized her now. His mind was
swept again and again with gusts of her attraction.
Thoughts of hers came to him almost stinging with
reality ... and to see her again&mdash;to see her again.
Once in the intensity of his outpouring, he halted as if
she had called&mdash;as if she had called to him to come
up to her out of the hollows and the vagueness of
light.</p>

<p>It was nightfall. He gave way suddenly&mdash;to that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>double-crossing of temptation which forces upon the
tempted one the conviction that what he desires is the
right thing.... He would be a fool not to go. She
would expect him.... He arose and set out for
her house.</p>

<p>But as he neared the corner something within felt
itself betrayed.</p>

<p>“And so I cannot be content with her happiness,” he
thought. “I cannot be content with the little mysteries
that make her the <i>one</i> Betty Berry. I am not brave
enough to be happy alone&mdash;as she is. I must have the
woman....”</p>

<p>He was hot with the shame of it. He saw her
bountifulness; her capacity to wait. Clearly he saw that
all these complications and conflicts of his own mind
were not indications of a large nature, but the failures
of one unfinished. She did not torture herself with
thoughts; she obeyed a heart unerringly true and real.
She shone as never before; fearless, yet with splendid
zeal for giving; free to the sky, yet eager to linger low
and tenderly where her heart was in harmony; a stranger
to all, save one or two in the world, pitilessly hungry
to be known, and yet asking so little.... Compared
with her, he saw himself as a littered house, wind
blowing through broken windows.</p>

<p>... That night, sitting with Duke Fallows before
the fire, brooding on his own furious desires, he
thought of the other John Morning who had brooded
over the story of Liaoyang in so many rooms with the
same companion. All that former brooding had only
forced the world to a show-down. He knew, forever,
how pitifully little the world can give.... A cabin
on the hill and a name that meant a call in the next
war....</p>

<p>The face of the other cooled and stilled him. Duke
was troubled; Duke, who wasn’t afraid of kings or
armies or anything that the world might do; who didn’t
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>seem even afraid now of the old Eve violence, whoever
she was&mdash;was afraid to speak of Betty Berry to his best
friend.... Morning wondered at this. Had Duke
given up&mdash;or was he afraid of mixing things more if he
expressed himself? The fire-lit face was tense. One
after another of the man’s splendid moments and performances
ran through Morning’s mind&mdash;the enveloping
compassion&mdash;in Tokyo, Liaoyang, in the grain, in the
ploughed lands&mdash;the Lowenkampf friend, the friend of
the peasant house, the friend of men in Metal Workers’
Hall, his own friend in a score of places and ways&mdash;the
man’s consummate art in friendliness....</p>

<p>“Duke, there’s a lot to think about in just plain living,
isn’t there?”</p>

<p>The other started. “Hello,” he said. “I didn’t think
you were in my world.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Betty Berry was waiting at the stairs the next
morning.</p>

<p>“Did you get my letter?” she whispered, when the
door had swung to.</p>

<p>“No.... Mailed last night?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I left the cabin two hours before the mail. It’s
rural delivery, you know. Jethro reaches my box late in
the forenoon&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I wrote it about dark, but didn’t mail it until later.
I thought you would come&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He told her how he had written, how he had come
to her house, and turned away. They were very happy.</p>

<p>“To think that you came so far. I couldn’t sit still,
I was so expectant at that very time.... But it
was good for us&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I understood after a while.”</p>

<p>“Of course, you understood.... I was&mdash;oh, so
happy yesterday. Yet, aren’t we strange? Before it
was night, I wanted you to come back.... I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>didn’t go out last night. I couldn’t practice. To-night,
there are some friends whom I must see&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Morning, in a troubled way, reckoned the hours until
evening.... She was here and there about the
room. The place already reflected her. She had never
been so blithe before.... It was an hour afterward
that he picked up a little tuning-fork from the
dresser, and twanged it with his nail. She started and
turned to him, her thumb pressed against her lips&mdash;her
whole attitude that of a frightened child.</p>

<p>“I wonder if I could tell you?” she said hesitatingly.
“It would make many things clear. You told me about
little boy&mdash;you. It was my father’s&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He waited without speaking.</p>

<p>“... He used to lead the singing in a city
church,” she said. “Always he carried the tuning-fork.
He would twang it upon a cup or a piece of wood, and
put it to his ear&mdash;taking the tone. He had a soft tenor
voice. There was never another just like it, and always
he was humming.... I remember his lips moving
through the long sermons, as he conned the hymn-book,
one song after another, tapping his fork upon a signet
ring. How I remember the tiny twanging, the light hum
of an insect that came from him, from song to song,
his finger keeping time, his lips pursed over the
words.</p>

<p>“He never heard the preacher. There was no organ
allowed, but he led the hymns. He loved it. He held
the time and tone for the people&mdash;but never sang a hymn
twice the same, bringing in the strangest variations, but
always true, his face flaming with pleasure.</p>

<p>“For years and years we lived alone. As a little girl,
I was lifted to the stool to play his accompaniments. As
a young woman, I supported him, giving music lessons.
The neighbors thought him an invalid.... All his
viciousness was secret from the world, but common property
between us from my babyhood. I pitied him and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>covered him, fed him when he might have fed himself,
waited upon him when he might have helped me. He
would hold my mind with little devilish things and
thoughts&mdash;as natural to him as the tuning-fork....
He would despoil the little stock of food while I was
away, and nail the windows down. My whole life, I
marveled at the ingenuity of his lies. He was so little
and helpless. I never expected to be treated as a decent
creature, from those who had heard his tales. They
looked askance at me.</p>

<p>“For years, he told me that he was dying, and I sat
with him in the nights, or played or read aloud. If any
one came, he lay white and peaceful, with a look of
martyrdom.... And then at the last, I fell asleep
beside him. It was late, but the lamp was burning. I
felt him touch me before morning&mdash;the little old white
thing, his lips pursed. The tuning-fork dropped with a
twang to the floor. I could not believe I was free&mdash;but
cried and cried. At the funeral, when the church people
spoke of ‘our pain-racked and martyred brother’&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>She did not finish.</p>

<p>Morning left her side. “I never thought of a little
girl that way,” he said, standing apart. “Why, you have
given me the spirit of her, Betty. It is what you have
passed through that has made you perfect.... And
I was fighting for myself, and for silly things all the
time&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>But he had not expressed what was really in his
mind&mdash;of the beauty and tenderness of unknown women
everywhere, in whose hearts the sufferings of others find
arable ground. Surely, these women are the grace of
the world. His mother must have been weathered by
such perfect refinements, otherwise he would not have
been able to appreciate it in Betty Berry. It was all too
dreamy to put into words yet, but he felt it very important
in his life&mdash;this that had come to him from
Betty’s story, and from Betty standing there&mdash;woman’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>power, her bounty, her mystic valor, all from the unconscious
high behavior of a child.</p>

<p>She had given him something that the <i>Ploughman</i>
gave Duke Fallows. He wanted to make the child live
in the world’s thoughts, as Duke was making the <i>Ploughman</i>
live.</p>

<p>It was these things&mdash;common, beautiful, passed-by
things, that revealed to Morning, as he began to be ready&mdash;the
white flood of spirit that drives the world, that is
pressing always against hearts that are pure.</p>

<p>He went nearer to her.</p>

<p>“Everything I think is love for you, Betty,” he said.</p>

<p>The air was light about her, and delicate as from
woodlands.</p>

<p class="ph2">14</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> horse and phaeton&mdash;both very old&mdash;of the rural-carrier
could be seen from the hill-cabin. Duke
Fallows walked down to the fence to say “Hello” to
Jethro whom he admired. He returned bearing very
thoughtfully a letter addressed to John Morning. It
was from across the river; the name, street, and number
of the sender were written upon the envelope....
Fallows sat down before the fire again, staring
at the letter. He thought of the woman who had written
this, (just the few little things that Morning had
said) and then he thought of the gaunt peasant woman
in Russia, the mate of the <i>Ploughman</i>, and of the mother
of the <i>Ploughman</i>. He thought of the little boy, Jan&mdash;the
one little boy of the six, that had his heart, and
whom he longed for.</p>

<p>He thought of this little boy on one hand&mdash;and the
world on the other.</p>

<p>Then he thought of Morning again, and of the
woman.</p>

<p>He loved the world; he loved the little boy. Sometimes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
it seemed to him when he was very happy&mdash;that
he loved the world and the little boy with almost the
same compassion&mdash;the weakness, fineness, and innocence
of the races of men seeming almost like the child’s.</p>

<p>He thought of John Morning differently. He had
loved him at first, because he was down and fighting
grimly. He thought of him of late as an instrument,
upon which might be played a message of mercy and
power to all who suffered&mdash;to the world and to the little
boy alike.</p>

<p>And now Fallows was afraid for the instrument.
Many things had maimed it, but this is the way of men;
and these maimings had left their revelations from the
depths. Such may measure into the equipment of a big
man, destined to meet the many face to face. Fallows
saw this instrument in danger of being taken over by a
woman&mdash;to be played upon by colorful and earthly seductions.
No man could grant more readily than he,
that such interpretations are good for most men; that
the highest harmony of the average man is the expression
of love for his one woman and his children. But
to John Morning, Fallows believed such felicity would
close for life the great work which he had visioned from
the beginning.</p>

<p>He did not want lyrical singing from John Morning,
he wanted prophetic thunderings.</p>

<p>He wanted this maimed young man to rise up from
the dregs and tell his story and the large meaning of it.
He wanted him to burn with a white light before the
world. He wanted the Koupangtse courage to drive into
the hearts of men; a pure reformative spirit to leap forth
from the capaciousness where ambition had been; he
wanted John Morning to ignite alone. He believed the
cabin in which he now sat was built blindly from the
boy’s standpoint, but intelligently from the spirit of the
boy, to become the place of ignition. He believed this
of Morning’s to be a celibate spirit that could be finally
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>maimed only by a woman. He believed that Morning
was perfecting a marvelous instrument, one that would
alter all society for the better, if he gave his heart to
the world.</p>

<p>Fallows even asked himself if he did not have his
own desperate pursuits among women in too close consideration....
It would be easy to withdraw. So
often he had faltered before the harder way, and found
afterward that the easy one was evil.... He left
it this way: If he could gain audience with Betty Berry
alone this evening he would speak; if Morning were with
her, he would find an excuse for joining them and
quickly depart. Last night Morning had returned to the
cabin early; the night before by the last car. It was
less than an even chance.... Fallows crossed the
river, thinking, if the woman were common it would be
easy. The way it turned out left no doubt as to what
he must do. Approaching the number, on the street
named on the corner of the envelope, he passed John
Morning, head down in contemplation. He was admitted
to the house. Betty Berry appeared, led him to
a small upper parlor, and excused herself for a moment.</p>

<p>Fallows sat back and closed his eyes. He was suffering.
All his fancied hostility was gone. He saw a woman
very real, and to him magical; he saw that this was
bloody business.... She came back, the full terror
of him in her eyes. She did not need to be so sensitive
to know that he had not come as a cup-bearer....
He was saying to himself, “I will not struggle
with her....”</p>

<p>“Have I time to tell my story?”</p>

<p>“I was going out.... John Morning just went
away because I was to meet old friends. But, if this is
so very important, of course&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It is about him.”</p>

<p>“I think you must tell your story.”</p>

<p>Fallows talked of Morning’s work, of what he had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>first seen from Luzon, and of the man he found in Tokyo.
He spoke of the days and nights in Liaoyang, as he had
watched Morning at his work.</p>

<p>“He’s at his best at the type-writer. When the work
is really coming right for him, he seems to be used by a
larger, finer force than he shows at other times....
It is good to talk to you, Miss Berry. You are a real
listener. You seem to know what I am to say next&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Go on,” she said.</p>

<p>“When a man with a developed power of expression
stops writing what the world is saying, and learns to
listen to that larger, finer force within him&mdash;indeed,
when he has a natural genius for such listening, and
cultivates a better receptivity, always a finer and more
sensitive surface for its messages&mdash;such a man becomes
in time the medium between man and the energy that
drives the world&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Some call this energy that drives the world the
Holy Spirit, and some call it the Absolute. I call it
love of God. A few powerful men of every race are
prepared to express it. These individuals come up like
the others through the dark, often through viler darkness.
They suffer as others cannot dream of suffering.
They are put in terrible places&mdash;each of which leaves its
impress upon the instrument&mdash;the mind. You have read
part of John Morning’s story. Perhaps he has told you
other parts. His mind is furrowed and transcribed with
terrible miseries.</p>

<p>“Until recently his capacity was stretched by the furious
passion of ambition. It seemed in Asia as if he
couldn’t die, unexpressed; as if the world couldn’t kill
him. You saw him at the Armory just after he had
passed through thirty days hard enough to slay six men.
Ambition held him up&mdash;and hate and all the powers of
the ego.</p>

<p>“This is what I want to tell you: ‘When the love of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>God fills that furious capacity which ambition has made
ready; when the love of God floods over the broadened
surfaces of his mind, furrowed and sensitized by suffering,
filling the matrix which the dreadful experiences
have marked so deeply&mdash;John Morning will be a wonderful
instrument of interpretation between God and his
race.’</p>

<p>“I can make my story very short for you, Miss
Berry. Your listening makes it clearer than ever to me.
I see what men mean when they say they can write to
women. Yes, I see it.... John Morning has made
ready his cup. It will be filled with the water of life&mdash;to
be carried to men. But John Morning must feel first
the torture of the thirst of men.</p>

<p>“Every misery he has known has brought him nearer
to this realization; days here among the dregs of the
city; days of hideous light and shadow; days on the
China Sea, sitting with coolies crowded so they could not
move; days afield, and the perils; days alone in his little
cabin on the hill; sickness, failures, hatreds from men,
the answering hatred of his fleshly heart&mdash;all these have
knit him with men and brought him understanding.</p>

<p>“He has been down among men. Suffering has
graven his mind with the mysteries of the fallen. You
must have understanding to have compassion. In John
Morning, the love of God will pass through human
deeps to men. Deep calls to deep. He will meet the
lowest face to face. He will bring to the deepest down
man the only authority such a man can recognize&mdash;that
of having been there in the body. And the thrill of rising
will be told. Those who listen and read will know
that he has been there, and see that he is risen. He will
tell how the water of life came to him&mdash;and flooded over
him, and healed his miseries and his pains. The splendid
shining authority of it will rise from his face and from
his book.</p>

<p>“And men won’t be the same after reading and listening;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
(nor women who receive more quickly and passionately)&mdash;women
won’t be the same. Women will
see that those who suffer most are the real elect of this
world. It’s wonderful to make women listen, Miss
Berry, for their children bring back the story.</p>

<p>“It isn’t that John Morning must turn to love God.
I don’t mean that. He must love men. He must receive
the love of God&mdash;and give it to men. To be able
to listen and to receive with a trained instrument of
expression, and then to turn the message to the service
of men&mdash;that’s a World-Man’s work. John Morning will
do it&mdash;if he loves humanity enough. He’s the only living
man I know who has a chance. He will achieve
almost perfect instrumentation. He will express what
men need most to know in terms of art and action. The
love of God must have man to manifest it, and that’s
John Morning’s work&mdash;if he loves humanity enough to
make her his bride.”</p>

<p>Fallows was conscious now of really seeing her.
She had not risen, but seemed nearer&mdash;as if the chair,
in which she slowly rocked, had crept nearer as he
talked. Her palms resting upon her knees were turned
upward toward him:</p>

<p>“And you think John Morning is nearly ready for
that crown of Compassion?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You think he will receive the Compassion&mdash;and give
it to men in terms of art and action?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You think if he loves me&mdash;if he turns his love to me,
as he is doing&mdash;he cannot receive that greater love which
he must give men?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And you think it would be a good woman’s part to
turn him from her?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And you came to tell me this?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span></p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I think it is true&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, listen&mdash;listen&mdash;&mdash;” he cried, rising and bending
over her&mdash;“a good woman’s part&mdash;it would be that! It
would be something more&mdash;something greater than even
he could ever do.... What a vision you have
given me!”</p>

<p>She stood before him, her face half-turned to the
window. Yet she seemed everywhere in the room&mdash;her
presence filling it. He could not speak again. He turned
to go. Her words reached him as he neared the door.</p>

<p>“Oh, if I only had my little baby&mdash;to take away!”</p>

<p class="ph2">15</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">F</span>allows</span> stood forward on the ferry that night
and considered the whole New York episode. He
had done his work. He had told the <i>Ploughman</i> story
five times. It was just the sowing. He might possibly
come back for the harvest.... He had another
story to tell now. Could he ever tell it without breaking?...
He had tortured his brain to make things
clear for Morning and for men. He realized that a man
who implants a complete concept in another intelligence
and prevents it from withering until roots are formed
and fruitage is assured, performs a miracle, no less; because,
if the soil were ready, the concept would come of
itself. He had driven his brain by every torment to
make words perform this miracle on a large scale.</p>

<p>And this little listening creature he had just left&mdash;she
had taken his idea, finished it for him, and involved
it in action. To her it was the Cross. She had carried
it to Golgotha, and sunk upon it with outstretched
palms.... There was an excellence about Betty
Berry that amazed him, in that it was in the world....
He had not called such women to him, because
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>such women were not the answer to his desires. He
realized with shame that a man only knows the women
who answer in part the desires of his life. Those who
had come to him were fitted to the plane of sensation
upon which he had lived so many years. He had condemned
all women because, in the weariness of the
flesh, he had suddenly risen to perceive the falsity of
his affinities of the flesh. “What boys we are!” he
whispered, “in war and women and work&mdash;what boys!”</p>

<p>Betty Berry had taught him a lesson, quite as enormous
to his nature as the <i>Ploughman’s</i>. A man who
thinks of women only in sensuousness encounters but
half-women. He had learned it late, but well, that a
man in this world may rise to heights far above his
fellows in understanding, but that groups of women are
waiting on all the higher slopes of consciousness for
their sons and brothers and lovers to come up. They
pass their time weaving laurel-leaves for the brows of
delayed valiants....</p>

<p>Duke thought of the men he had seen afield, the
gravity with which these men did their great fighting
business, the world talking about them. Then he thought
of the little visionary in her room accepting her
tragedy....</p>

<p>Even now, in the hush and back-swing of the pendulum,
it seemed very true what he had said. She had
seen it. It is dangerous business to venture to change
the current of other lives; no one knew it better than
Fallows. But he considered Morning. Morning, as it
were, had been left on his door-step. Morning would
be alone now&mdash;alone to listen and receive his powers....
Fallows looked up from the black water to the
far-apart pickets of the wintry night. He was going
home.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The cabin was lit. Fallows climbed the hill wearily.
There was a certain sharpness as of treachery from his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>night’s work, but to that larger region of mind, open
to selfishness and the passion to serve men, peace had
come. He was going home, first to San Francisco&mdash;then
to the Bosks and the little boy.</p>

<p>Morning arose quickly at the sound of the step on the
hard ground, and opened the door wide. He had been
reading her letter, which Fallows had left upon the
table. The letter had been like an added hour with her.
It was full of shy joy, full of their perfect accord, remote
from the world&mdash;its road and stone-piles and
evasions.... Fallows saw that he looked white
and wasted. The red of the firelight did not mislead
his eye. Its glow was not Morning’s and did not blend
with the pallor.</p>

<p>“I’m going on to-morrow, John,” he said.</p>

<p>“’Frisco?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;and then&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You’ll come back here?”</p>

<p>“No, I’ll keep on into the west to <i>my</i> cabin&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It would be nearer this way. I planned to see you
after ’Frisco.”</p>

<p>“I’ll come back,” Fallows’ thought repeated, “for the
harvest.”</p>

<p>“And so you are going to make the big circle again?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t finished this first one, until you reach
Noyes and your desk in the <i>Western States</i>.”</p>

<p>“The next journey won’t take so long.”</p>

<p>“You’ve been the good angel to me again, Duke.
It’s quite a wonder, how you turn up in disaster of
mine.... I wonder if I shall ever come to you&mdash;but
you won’t get down. You wouldn’t even stay ill.”</p>

<p>“You won’t get down again, John, at least, in none of
the ways you know about&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Both men seemed spent beyond words....
Morning saw in the other’s departure the last bit of
resistance lifted from his heart’s quest. Betty Berry had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>come between them. Morning’s conviction had never
faltered on the point that Fallows was structurally weak
on this one matter.... And so he was going. All
that was illustrious in their friendship returned. They
needed few words, but sat late before turning in. The
cabin cooled and freshened. Each had the thought, before
finally falling asleep, that they were at sea again....
And in the morning the thing that lived from
their parting was this, from Duke Fallows:</p>

<p>“Whatever you do, John&mdash;don’t forget your own&mdash;the
deepest down man. He is yours&mdash;go after him&mdash;get
him!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>... She was at the top of the stairs when he
called the next morning; and he was only half-way up
when he saw that she had on her hat and coat and
gloves. The day was bitter like the others. He had
thought of her fire, and the quiet of her presence. He
meant to tell her all about Duke Fallows and the going.
It was his thought&mdash;that she might find in this (not
through words, but through his sense of release from
Duke’s antagonism) a certain quickening toward their
actual life together. He wanted to talk of bringing her
to the cabin&mdash;at least, for her to come for a day.</p>

<p>“You will go with me to get the tickets and things.
I must start west at once.”</p>

<p>It was quite dark in the upper hallway. Morning
reached out and turned her by the elbow, back toward
the door of her room. There in the light, he looked into
her face. She was calm, her eyes bright. Whatever
the night had brought&mdash;if weakness it was mastered, if
exaltation it was controlled. But she was holding very
hard. There was a tightness about her mouth that terrified
him. It was not as it had been with them; he was
not one with her.</p>

<p>“You mean that you are going away&mdash;for some
time?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span></p>

<p>“Yes.... Oh, you must not mind. We are
road people. We have been wonderfully happy. You
must not look so tragic&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>It wasn’t like her at all. “We are not road people,”
he thought.... “You must not look so tragic,”&mdash;that
was just like a thing road people might say.</p>

<p>He sat down. The weakness of his limbs held his
mind. It seemed to him, if he could forget his body,
words might come. At first the thought of her going
away was intolerable, but that had dwindled. It was the
change in her&mdash;the something that had happened&mdash;the
flippancy of her words.... He looked up suddenly.
It seemed as if her arms had been stretched toward him,
her face ineffably tender. So quickly it had happened
that he could not be sure. He wanted this very thing so
much that his mind might have formed the illusion. He
let it pass. He did not want her to say it was not so.</p>

<p>Words of her letter came back to him. Neither the
letter nor yesterday had anything to do with this day....
“You are drawing closer all the time. I have
been so happy to-day that I had to write. You must
know that I sent you away because I could not bear
more happiness....”</p>

<p>Where was it? What had happened? He was fevered.
Something was destroying him.... Betty
Berry did not suffer for herself&mdash;it was with pity for
him. The mother in her was tortured. It was her own
life&mdash;this love of his for her&mdash;the only child she would
ever have. She had loved its awakenings, its diffidences,
the faltering steps of its expression. The man was not
hers, but his love for her was her very own....
She had not thought of its death, when Fallows talked
the night before. She had thought of <i>her</i> giving up
for his sake, but not of the anguish and the slaying of
his love for her. And this was taking place now.</p>

<p>“You will let me write to you?” he said, still thinking
of the letter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, yes.”</p>

<p>“And you will write to me?”</p>

<p>She remembered now what she had written....
The fullness of her heart had gone into that. She could
not write like that again. Yet he was asking for her
letters, as a child might ask for a drink.... She
could not refuse. It wasn’t in nature to see his face,
and refuse.... Surely if she remained apart it was
all any one could ask.</p>

<p>“Yes, I will write sometimes.”</p>

<p>He stood in the center of the room, his head bowed
slightly, his eyes upon the wall. He was ill, bewildered,
his mind turning here and there only to find fresh distress....
Suddenly he remembered that he had not
told her of his drinking.... That must be it.
Some one else had told her, and she was hurt and
broken.</p>

<p>“I meant always to tell you,” he said. “Only it
really did not seem to signify by the time you came
back. And when I was with you&mdash;oh, I seemed very far
from that. I don’t understand it now&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>She did not know what he meant; did not care,
could not ask. It was something he clutched&mdash;in the
disintegration.... He looked less death-like in his
thinking of it.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t greatly matter,” she said. “I have to go
west.... Won’t you come with me to get the
tickets?”</p>

<p>“I can’t go out into the street yet. If there is
anything more I have done&mdash;won’t you let me
know?”</p>

<p>Suddenly he realized her side, that he was detaining
her; that it wasn’t easy for her to speak. It was not
his way to impose his will upon anyone; his natural
shyness now arose, and he fingered his hat.</p>

<p>“Dear John Morning&mdash;you haven’t done anything.
You have made me happy. I must go away to my work&mdash;and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
you, to yours.... It is hard for me, but I see
it as the way. I have promised to write&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The words came forth like birds escaping&mdash;thin,
evasive, vain words. That which she had seen so clearly
the night before, (and which she seemed utterly to have
lost the meaning of) was a lock upon every real utterance
now. She had not counted upon this tragedy of her
mother instinct&mdash;this slaying of the perfect thing in him,
which she had loved to life.</p>

<p>He arose, and sat down; he swallowed, started to
speak, but could not. He was like a boy&mdash;this man who
had seen so much, just a bewildered boy, his suffering
too deep for words&mdash;the sweetest part of him to her,
dying before her eyes. And the dream of their service
together, their hand-in-hand going out to the world,
their poverty and purity and compassion together&mdash;these
were lost jewels.... It was all madness, the world&mdash;all
madness and devilishness. Beauty and virtue and
loving kindness were gone, the world turned insane....
The thought came to tell <i>him</i> she was insane;
a better lie still, that she was not a pure woman. She
started to speak, but his eyes came up to her....
She tried it again, but his eyes came up to her. He
fingered his hat boyishly. The mother in her breast
could not.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Their dreadful night. The winter darkness was coming
on swiftly. Her train was leaving.</p>

<p>“But you said you were not going to work for the
present. You have been working so hard all winter&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He had said it all before.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;but there is much for me to do&mdash;days of study
and practice&mdash;and thinking. You will understand....
Everything will come clear and you will understand.
You see, to-day&mdash;this isn’t a day for words with
us.... One must have one’s own secret place.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>You must say of me, ‘She suddenly remembered something&mdash;and
had to go away.’...”</p>

<p>“‘She suddenly remembered something and had to
hurry away,’” he repeated, trying to smile. “But she
will write to me. I will work&mdash;work&mdash;and when you
let me, I will come to you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He had to leave.... He kissed her again.
There was something like death about it.</p>

<p>“If we <i>were</i> only dead,” she said, “and were going
away together&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>... A man stepped up to him, regarded him intently.
Morning realized that he must get alone. He
had been shaking his head wearily, and unseeingly&mdash;standing
in the main corridor of the station in Jersey&mdash;shaking
his head.... It was full night outside.
He forgot that he did not have to recross the river&mdash;and
was on the ferry back to New York before he
remembered....</p>

<p>He gained the hill to his cabin long afterward. That
reminded him that Duke Fallows had gone, too&mdash;and
that very morning.</p>

<p>It seemed farther back in his life than Liaoyang.</p>

<p class="ph2">16</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">B</span>etty Berry’s</span> journey was ten hours west by
the limited trains&mdash;straight to the heart of her
one tried friend, Helen Quiston, a city music teacher.
Her first thought, and the one buoy, was that she would
be able to tell everything.... She could not make
Helen Quiston feel the pressure that his Guardian
Spirit (she always thought of Duke Fallows so) invoked
in that half-hour of his call, but with a day or a night
she could make her friend know what had happened, and
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>something of the extent of force which had led to her
sacrifice. Helen would tell her if she were mad. All
through that night she prayed that her friend would call
her mad&mdash;would force her to see that the thing she had
done was viciously insane.</p>

<p>She was engulfed. For the first time, her spirit
failed to right itself in any way. She was more dependent
upon Helen Quiston than she had conceived
possible, since the little girl had fought out the different
cruel presentations of the days, during the early life with
her father.</p>

<p>Throughout the night <i>en route</i> she thought of the
letter she had promised to write to John Morning. The
day with him had brought the letter from a vague promise
to an immediate duty upon her reaching the studio....
She was to write first, and at once. Already
she was making trials in her mind, but none would do.
He would penetrate every affectation. The wonder and
dreadfulness of it&mdash;was that she must not tell the truth,
for he would be upon her, furiously human, disavowing
all separateness from the race, as one with a message
must be; disavowing the last vestige of the dream of
compassion which his Guardian Spirit had pictured....
She knew his love for her. She had seen it
suffer. Would Helen Quiston show her that she must
bring it back&mdash;that the Guardian Spirit was evil? There
was a fixture about it, a whispering of the negative deep
within.</p>

<p>She could not write of the memories. Not the least
linger of perfume from that night at the theatre must
touch her communication. Yet it was the arch of all.
As she knew her soul and his, they had been as pure as
children that night&mdash;even before a word was spoken. It
had been so natural&mdash;such a rest and joy.... She
had learned well to put love away, before he came. From
the few who approached, she had laughed and withdrawn.
The world had daubed them. In her heart toward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
other men, she was as a consecrated nun. And this
was like her Lord who had come.... She had
made her way in the world among men. She knew them,
worked among them, pitied them. Her father had been
as weak, as evil, as passionate, as pitiable. In the beginning
she had learned the world through him&mdash;all its
bitter, brutal lessons. As she knew the ’cello and its
literature, she knew the world and the cheap artifices it
would call arts.... She had even put away judgments;
she had covered her eyes; accustomed her ears
to patterings; made her essential happiness of little
things; she had labored truly, and lived on, wondering
why. And he had come at last with understanding. She
had seen in Morning potentially all that a woman loves,
and cannot be. He had made her mind and heart fruitful
and flourishing again. Then his Guardian Spirit
had appeared and spoken. As of old there had been
talk of a serpent. As of old the serpent was of
woman.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Helen Quiston was just leaving for a forenoon’s
work away from the studio. She sat down for a moment
holding the other in her arms; then she made tea
and toast, and hastened off to return as quickly as possible....
For a long time Betty Berry stood by
the piano. The day was gray and cold, but the studio
was softly shining. All the woods of it were dark,
approximately the black of the grand piano; floors and
walls and picture frames were dark, but the openings
were broad, and naked trees stirred outside the back
windows.... She did not look the illness that was
upon her. She was a veteran in suffering.... She
forgot to breathe, until the need of air suddenly caught
and shook her throat. It was often so when the hidden
beauty of certain music unfolded to her for the first
time.</p>

<p>She went to the rear windows, gradually realizing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>that it would soon be spring-time. There was a swift,
tangible hurt in this that brought tears. There had been
no tears for the inner desolation.... “Poor dear
John Morning,” she whispered.</p>

<p>The reproduction of a wonderful painting of the
meeting of Beatrice and Dante held her eye for a long
time.... The blight was upon her as she tried a
last time to write. It spread over her hand and the table,
the room, the day. There was a hurt for him in everything
she wanted to say. She was hot and ill&mdash;her back,
her brain, her eyes, from trying. She could not hurt
him any more. He had done nothing but give her healing
and visions. His Guardian had done nothing but
tell the truth, which she had seen at the time. This
agony of hers had existed. It was like everything else
in the world.</p>

<p>She wrote at last of their service in the world. They
needed, she said, the strong air of solitude to think out
the perfect way. It was very hard for her, who had
fared so long on dreams and denials and loneliness. He
must remember that. “Great things come to those who
love at a distance,” she wrote bravely. Tears started
when she saw the sentence standing so dauntlessly upon
the page of her torture.... It would make them
kinder, make their ideals live&mdash;and how young they
were!... She said that she was afraid to be so
happy as he had made her in certain moments. Often
she found herself staring at the picture of Beatrice and
Dante.</p>

<p>The thought that broke in upon this brave writing
was that she was denied the thrill of great doing, as it
had come to her while Fallows had spoken.... It
would have lived on, had she gone that night, without
seeing Morning again. Moreover, her way was different
from that which she had pictured, as his Guardian
talked. She did not see then that her action made a kind
of lie of all her giving up to that hour; and that there
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>could be no united sacrifice. It was pure, voiceless sacrifice
for her&mdash;and blind murdering for him....</p>

<p>From the choke of this, her mind would turn to the
song of triumph her spirit had sung as his Guardian told
the story.... She had seemed to live in a vast
eternal life, as she listened; and this which she was
asked to do&mdash;was just to attend a temporary flesh sickness.
She had the strange blessedness that comes with
the conviction that immortality is here and now, as those
few men and women of the world have known in their
highest moments.</p>

<p>She could get back nothing of that exaltation. It
would never come again. The spirit it had played upon
was broken.... She had been rushing away on her
thoughts. It was afternoon, the letter unfinished, the
’cello staring at her from the corner. It had stood by
her in all her sorrows of the years, but was empty as a
fugue now&mdash;endless variations upon the one theme of
misery.... Happiness does not come back to the
little things&mdash;after one has once known the breath of
life.... She closed the narrow way of the letter,
which she had filled with words&mdash;no past nor future,
only the darkness that had come in to mingle with the
dark hangings of the room of her friend.... She
kissed the pages and sent them back the way she had
come in the night.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The qualities that had brought her the friend, Helen
Quiston, and which had made the friendship so real,
were the qualities of Betty Berry. She had come to the
last woman to be told of her madness, or to find admonition
toward breaking down the thing she had begun....
They had talked for hours that night.</p>

<p>“I know it is lovely, dear Betty. Why, you look
lovelier this instant than I ever dreamed you could be.
Loving a man seems to do that to a woman&mdash;but the
privilege of the greater thing! Oh, you <i>are</i> privileged.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>That’s the way of the great love. I should like sometime
to know that Guardian. How did mere man grasp
the beauty and mystery of service like that?...
Stay with me. I will serve you, hands and feet. It is
enough for me to touch the garment’s hem....
You are already gone from us, dearest. You have loved
a man. You do love a man. He is worthy. You have
not found him wanting. What matters getting him&mdash;when
you have found your faith? Think of us&mdash;think
of the gray sisterhood you once belonged to&mdash;nuns of the
world&mdash;who go about their work helping, and who say
softly to each other as they pass, ‘No, I have not been
able to find him yet.’”</p>

<p class="ph2">17</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">M</span>orning</span> awoke in the gray of the winter morning.
The place was cold and impure. He had
fallen asleep without the accustomed blasts of hill-sweeping
wind from window to window. He had not started
the fire the night before; had merely dropped upon his
cot, dazed with suffering and not knowing his weariness.
He was reminded of places he had awakened in other
times when he could not remember how he got to bed.
Beyond the chairs and table lay the open fire-place, the
ashes hooded in white.</p>

<p>The blackness of yesterday returned, but with a hot
resentment against himself that he had not known before.
He had followed Betty Berry about for hours, and
had not penetrated the hollow darkness with a single
ray of intelligence. This dreadful business was his, yet
he had been stricken; had scarcely found his speech.
There was no doubt of Betty Berry now, though a dozen
evasions of hers during the day returned. She was doing
something hard, but something she thought best to
do. The real truth, however, was rightly his property....
To-day she would write. To-morrow her letter
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>would come. If it did not contain some reality upon
which he might stand through the present desolation, he
would go to her.... Yes, he would go to her.</p>

<p>His side was hurting. He was used to that; it had
no new relation now. Everything was flat and wretched.
Distaste for himself and this nest in which he had lain,
was but another of the miserable adjuncts of the morning.
He stood forth shivering from the cot; struck a
match and held it to some waste paper. Kindling was
ready in the fire-place, but the paper flared out and fell
to ashes, as he watched his left hand. He went to the
window and examined his hand closer. The nails were
broken and dry; there were whitish spots on the joints.
He had seen something of this before, but his physical
reactions had been so various and peculiar, in the past six
weeks, that he had refused to be disturbed.</p>

<p>Just now his mind was clamoring with memories.
He had the sense that as soon as an opening was forced
in his mind, a torrent would rush in. He felt his heart
striking hard and with rapidity. The floor heaved
windily, or was it the lightness of his limbs? He went
about the things to do with strange zeal, as if to keep
his brain from a contemplation so hideous that it could
not be borne.</p>

<p>He lit another paper, placed kindling upon it, poked
the charred stubs of wood free from the thick covering
of white, and brought fresh fuel. Then, as the fire
kindled, he opened the door and windows, and swept and
swept.... But it encroached upon him....
The open wound was no longer a mystery.... His
dream of the river and the boat that was not allowed to
land; his dream of the cliff, and looking down into the
life of earth through the tree-tops ... the ferry-man
of the Hun ... and now yesterday with its
two relations to the old cause.</p>

<p>His whole nature was prepared for the revelation;
yet it seemed to require years in coming. Like the loss
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>of the manuscript in the Liao ravine, it was done before
he knew.</p>

<p>“Of course, they had to rush away, when they found
out,” he mumbled. “Of course, they couldn’t stay. Of
course, they couldn’t be the ones to tell me.”</p>

<p>It might have been anywhere in China; the ferryman
on the Hun ... during the deck-passage....
It did not greatly matter. Some contact of the Orient
had started the slow virus on its long course in his veins.
He knew that it required from three to five years to
reach the stage of revealing itself as now. He saw it as
the source of his various recent indispositions, and realized
that he could not remain in his cabin indefinitely.
It would be well for a while. Neither Duke Fallows nor
Betty Berry would tell. He could keep his secret, and
then&mdash;to die in some island quarantine? None of that.
This was his life. He was master of it. He should die
when he pleased, and where.</p>

<p>... Yes, she had her gloves on, when he came.
She had not removed them all day, not even at the very
last.... How strange and frightened she had
been&mdash;how pitiful and hard for her! She could not have
told him. She had loved him&mdash;and had suddenly learned....
She had seen that he did not know.... It
must have come to her in the night&mdash;after the last
day of happiness. Perhaps the processes of its coming
to her were like his. He was sorry for Betty
Berry.</p>

<p>And he could not see her again; he could not see
her again. He passed the rest of the day with this
repetition.... His life was over. That’s what it
amounted to. Of course, he would not let them segregate
him. His cabin would do for a while, until the
secret threatened to reveal itself, and then he would
finish the business.... The two great issues leaned
on each other: The discovery of his mortal taint took
the stress from the tragedy of yesterday; and that he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>could not see Betty Berry again kept madness away
from the abominable death.... The worst of it
all was that the love-mating was ended. This brought
him to the end of the first day, when he began to think
of the Play.</p>

<p>The literary instinct, of almost equal disorder with
dramatic instinct, and which he had come to despise during
the past year, returned with the easy conformity of
an undesirable acquaintance&mdash;that reportorial sentence-making
faculty, strong as death, and as uncentering to
the soul of man. Morning saw himself searching libraries
for data on leprosy, being caught by officials&mdash;the
subject of nation-wide newspaper articles and magazine
specials, the pathos of his case variously appearing&mdash;Liaoyang
recalled&mdash;his own story&mdash;Reever Kennard relating
afresh the story of the stealing of <i>Mio Amigo</i>.
What a back-wash from days of commonness! The ego
and the public eye&mdash;two Dromios&mdash;equal in monkey-mindedness
and rapacity.</p>

<p>Morning was too shattered to cope with this ancient
dissipation at first.</p>

<p>After the warring and onrushing of different faculties,
a sort of coma fell upon the evil part, and the
ways of the woman came back to him. He sat by his fire
that night, the wound in his side forgotten, the essence
of Asia’s foulness in his veins, forgotten&mdash;and meditated
upon the sweetness of Betty Berry. He approached
her image with a good humility. He saw her with
something of the child upon her&mdash;as if he had suddenly
become full of years. “How beautiful she was!” he
would whisper; and then he would smile sadly at the
poor blind boy he had been, not to see her beautiful at
first.... To think, only three days before, she
had sent him away, because she could not endure, except
alone, the visitation of happiness that came to her. People
of such inner strength must have their secret times
and places, for their strength comes to them alone. To
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>think that he had not understood this at once....
He had been eloquent and did not know it.</p>

<p>“Hell,” he said, “that’s the only way one can say
the right thing&mdash;when he doesn’t plan it.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>... If his illness had been any common thing
she would not have been frightened away. He was sure
of this. It took Asia’s horror&mdash;to frighten her away.
He saw her now, how she must have fought with it. He
shuddered for her suffering on that day.... That
day&mdash;why it was only the day before yesterday....
He never realized before how the illusion, Time, is only
measurable by man’s feeling.... He was a little
surprised at Duke Fallows. He himself wouldn’t have
been driven off, if Duke had suddenly uncovered a leprous
condition. He had been driven off by Duke’s ideas,
but no fear of contagion could do it. Yet Duke was the
bravest man he had ever known&mdash;in such deep and astonishing
ways courageous. Yet he had been brought up
soft. He wasn’t naturally a man-mingler. It had been
too much for him. It was a staggerer&mdash;this. Fallows
was a Prince anyway. Every man to his own fear....
This was the second morning.</p>

<p>Old Jethro, the rural delivery carrier, drove by that
morning without stopping. She could not have mailed
her letter until last night&mdash;another day to wait for it.
Morning tried to put away the misery. Women never
think of mail-closing times. They put a letter in the
box and consider it delivered.... He puzzled on,
regarding the action of Duke Fallows, in the light
of what he would have done. No understanding
came.</p>

<p>All thoughts returned in the course of the hours, his
mind milling over and over again the different phases,
but each day had its especial theme. The first was that
he would not see Betty Berry again; that Duke Fallows
had been frightened away, the second; and on the third
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>morning, before dawn, he began to reckon with physical
death, as if this day’s topic had been assigned to
him.</p>

<p>Sister Death&mdash;she had been in the shadows before.
Occasionally he had shivered afterward, when he thought
of some close brush with her. She was all right, only he
had thought of her as an alien before. It really wasn’t
so&mdash;a blood sister now.... He recalled scenes in
the walled cities of China.... She had certainly
put over a tough one on him.... It would be in
this room. He wouldn’t wait until his appearance was
a revelation.... He would do the play. Something
that he could take, would free him from the present
inertia, so he could work for a while, a few
hours a day. When the play was done&mdash;the Sister
would come at his bidding.... He had always
thought of her as feminine. A line from somewhere
seemed to seize upon her very image&mdash;this time not sister,
but&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dark mother, always gliding near, with soft
feet&mdash;&mdash;</i></p>

<p>He faced her out on that third morning. Physically
there was but a tremor about the coming. Not the
suffering, but a certain touch and shake of the heart,
heaved him a little&mdash;the tough little pump stopped, its
fine incentive and its life business broken....
But that was only the rattle of the door-knob of
death.</p>

<p>It was all right. He wasn’t afraid. The devil, Ambition,
was pretty well strangled. There must be something
that lasts, in his late-found sense of the utter unimportance
of anything the world can give&mdash;the world
which appreciates only the boyish part of a real man’s
work. So he would take out with him a reality of the
emptiness of the voice of the crowd. Then the unclean
desire for drink was finished&mdash;none of that would cling
to him; moreover, no fighting passion to live on would
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>hold him down to the body of things.... But he
would pass the door with the love of Betty Berry&mdash;strong,
young, imperious, almost untried....
Would that come back with him? Does a matter of such
dimension die? Does one come back at all?...</p>

<p>Probably in this room....</p>

<p>Then he thought of the play that must be done in
this room; and curiously with it, identifying itself with
the play and the re-forming part of it, was the favorite
word of Duke Fallows’&mdash;<i>Compassion</i>. What a title for
the play! Duke’s word and Duke’s idea.... All
this brought him to the thought of Service, as he had
pictured it for Betty Berry&mdash;a life together doing things
for men&mdash;loving each other so much that there were
volumes to spare for the world&mdash;down among men&mdash;to
the deepest down man.</p>

<p>His throat tightened suddenly. He arose. A sob
came from him.... His control broke all at once....
How a little run of thoughts could tear down
a man’s will! It wasn’t fear at all&mdash;but the same depiction
running in his mind that had so affected Betty Berry
when she begged to be alone....</p>

<p>“The deepest down man&mdash;the deepest down man....
It is I, Duke!... Surely you must have
meant me all the time!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But it passed quickly, properly whipped and put away
with other matters&mdash;all but a certain relating together of
the strange trinity, Death, Service, and Betty Berry&mdash;which
he did not venture to play with, for fear of relapse....
He had been eating nothing. He must
go to Hackensack. The little glass showed him a haggard
and unshaven John Morning, but there was nothing
of the uncleanness about the face in reflection....
He heard the “giddap” of Jethro far on the road. The
old rig was coming.... It stopped at his box. He
hurried down the hill.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span></p>

<p class="ph2">18</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>wo</span> letters; one from Duke Fallows. Morning
opened this on the way up the slope. He was
afraid of the other. He wanted to be in the cabin with
the door shut&mdash;when that other was opened....
Fallows was joyous and tender&mdash;just a few lines written
on the way west: “... I won’t be long in ’Frisco.
I know that already. The <i>Western States</i> does very
well without me.... Soon on the long road to
Asia and Russia. I must look up Lowenkampf again before
going home. He was good to us, wasn’t he, John?...
And you, this old heart thrills for you. You
are coming on. I don’t know anything more you need.
I say you are coming on. You’ll do the Play and the
Book.... John, you ought to write the book of the
world’s heart.... And then you will get so full of
the passion to serve men that writing won’t be enough.
You will have to go down among them again&mdash;and
labor and lift among men. Things have formed about
you for this.... We are friends.... I am
coming back for the harvest.”</p>

<p>The sun had come out. Morning was standing in the
doorway as he finished. The lemon-colored light fell
upon the paper.... It wasn’t like Duke to write in
this vein&mdash;after running away. He repeated aloud a
sentence to this effect. Then he went in, shut the door,
and, almost suffocating from the tension, read the letter
of Betty Berry.</p>

<p>It was just such a letter as would have sent him to
her, before his realization of the illness.... He
saw her torture to be kind, and yet not to lift his hopes.
It was different from Fallows’, in that it fitted exactly to
what he now knew about himself. And he had to believe
from the pages that she loved him. There was an eternal
equality to that.... The air seemed full of
service. Two letters from his finest human relations,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>each stirring him to service. He did not see this just
now with the touch of bitterness that might have flavored
it all another time.... What was there about
him that made them think of him so? If they only
knew how meager and tainted so much of his thinking
was. Some men can never make the world see how little
they are.</p>

<p>He wrote to Betty Berry. Calm came to him, and
much the best moments that he had known in the three
days. He was apt to be a bit lyrical as a letter-lover&mdash;he
whose words were so faltering face to face with the
woman. Thoughts of the play came to his writing. He
was really in touch with himself again. He would never
lose that. He would work every day. When a man’s
work comes well&mdash;he can face anything.... The
play was begun the fourth day, and, on the fifth, another
letter from Betty Berry. This was almost all about his
work. She had seized upon this subject, and her letters
lifted his inspiration. She could share his work. There
was real union in that....</p>

<p>He was forgetting his devil for an hour at a time.
There were moments of actual peace and well-being. He
did not suffer more than the pain he had been accustomed
to so long. And then, a real spring day breathed
over the hill.</p>

<p>That morning, without any heat of producing, and
without any elation from a fresh letter from the woman,
he found that in his mind to say aloud:</p>

<p>“I’m ready for what comes.”</p>

<p>By a really dramatic coincidence, within ten minutes
after this fruitage of fine spirit, John Morning found an
old unopened envelope from Nevin, the little doctor of
the <i>Sickles</i>. He had recalled some data on Liaoyang
while inspecting the morning&mdash;something that might
prove valuable for the play, in the old wallet he had
carried afield. Looking for this in the moulded leather,
he found the letter Nevin had left in the Armory, before
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>departing&mdash;just a little before Betty Berry came that day....
Nevin had not come back. But Noyes and Field
had come.</p>

<p>Morning remembered that Nevin had spoken that
morning of finding something for the wound that
would not heal.... The remedy was Chinese. The
Doctor knew of its existence, but had procured the name
with great difficulty in the Chinese quarter....
Morning was to fast ten days while taking the treatment.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>He went about it with a laugh. The message had
renewed his deep affection for Nevin. It had come
forth from the hidden place where Nevin now toiled,
(secretly trying, doubtless, to cover every appearance of
his humanity).... He remembered how Nevin
had studied the wound that refused to heal. The last
thing had been his report on that. When there was
nothing more to be offered but felicities&mdash;he had
vanished.</p>

<p>Morning did not leap into any expectancy that he
was to be healed, but thoughts of Nevin gave him another
desire after the play and the book&mdash;to trace the great-hearted
little man before the end. Nevin would be found
somewhere out among the excessive desolations. If it
may be understood, the idea of mortal sickness remained
in Morning’s mind at this time, mainly as a barrier between
him and Betty Berry.</p>

<p>Nevin’s drug was procured in New York. Hackensack
failed utterly in this.... On the third day,
Morning suffered keenly for the need of food. A paragraph
from Betty Berry on the subject of the fasting at
this time completely astonished him; indeed, shook the
basic conviction as to the meaning of her departure:</p>

<p>“... I have often thought you did not seem so
well after I returned from Europe, as you were when
we parted. But the ten days will do for you, something
that makes whatever might happen in the body seem so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>little and unavailing.... Don’t you see, you are
doing what every one, destined to be a world-teacher,
has done?... What amazes me continually, is that
you seem to be brought, one by one, to these things by
exterior processes, rather than through any will of your
own.... The Hebrew prophets were all called
upon to do this in order to listen better. Recall, too, the
coming forth from the Wilderness of the Baptist, and the
forty days in the wilderness of the Master Himself.
Why, it is part of the formula! You will do more than
improve the physical health; you will hear your message
more clearly.... I sit and think&mdash;in the very hush
of expectancy for you.”</p>

<p>As the evidences came, so they vanished. She could
not have fled from him in the fear of leprosy and written
in this way; nor could Duke Fallows, who was first
of all unafraid of fleshly things. The conviction of his
taint, and of its incurableness, daily weakened. Before
the ten days passed, the last vestige of the horror was
cleaned away. Illusion&mdash;and yet the mental battle
through which he had passed, and which, through three
terrible days, had shaken him body and soul, was just
as real in the graving of its experience upon the fabric
of his being as was the journey to Koupangtse, done
hand and foot and horse. He perceived that man, farther
advanced in the complications of self-consciousness, covers
ground in three days and masters a lesson that would
require a life to learn in the dimness and leisure of
simple consciousness.</p>

<p>There was no way of missing this added fact: He,
John Morning, was not designed to lean. He had been
whipped and spurred through another dark hollow in
the valley of the shadow, to show him again, and finally,
that he was not intended for leaning upon others, yet
must have an instant appreciation of the suffering of
others. He had been forced to fight his own way to a
certain poise, through what was to him, at the time,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>actual abandonment in distress, by the woman and the
friend he loved. Moreover, he had accepted death; resignation
to death in its most horrible form had been driven
into his soul&mdash;an important life lesson, which whole
races of men have died to learn.</p>

<p>He was seeing very clearly.... He bathed continually
both in water and sunlight, lying in the open
doorway as the Spring took root on his hill and below.
Often he mused away the hours, with Betty Berry’s letters
in his hand&mdash;too weak almost to stir at last, but
filled with ease and well-being, such as he had never
known. Water from the Spring was all he needed,
and the activity of mind was pure and unerring, as
if he were lifted above the enveloping mists of the
senses, through which he had formerly regarded
life.</p>

<p>Everything now was large and clear. Life was like
a coast of splendid altitude, from which he viewed the
mighty distances of gilded and cloud-shadowed sea, birds
sailing vast-pinioned and pure, the breakers sounding
a part of the majestic harmony of granite and sea and
sky; the sun God-like, and the stars vast and pure like
the birds.</p>

<p>When he actually looked with his eyes, it was as if
he had come back, a man, to some haunt of childhood.
The little hill was just as lovely, a human delight in the
unbudded elms, a soft and childish familiarity in the
new greens of the sun-slope grass. The yellow primrose
was first to come, for yellow answers the thinnest, farthest
sunlight. The little cabin was like a cocoon. He was
but half-out. Soon the stronger sunlight would set him
free&mdash;then to the wings.... One afternoon he
stared across to the haze of the great city. His eyes
smarted with the thought of the Charleys and the sisters,
of the <i>Boabdils</i> and the slums.... Then, at
last, he thought of Betty Berry waiting and thinking of
him ... “in the very hush of expectancy.” The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>world was very dear and wonderful, and his love for her
was in it all.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was the ninth day that the bandage slipped from
him, as clean as when he put it on the day before, and
when he opened the door of the cabin he heard the first
robin.... There was a sweeping finality in the
way it had come from Nevin, and the quality of the man
lived in Morning’s appreciation. His friends were always
gone before he knew how fine they were.</p>

<p>He was slow to realize that the days of earth-life
were plentiful for him, in the usual course. A man is
never the same after he has accepted death....
And it had all come in order.... He could look
into her eyes and say, “Betty Berry, whatever you want,
is right for me, but I think it would be best for you to
tell me everything. We are strong&mdash;and if we are not
to be one together, we should talk it over and understand
perfectly.”...</p>

<p>How strange he had missed this straight way. There
had been so much illusion before. His body was utterly
weak, but his mind saw more clearly and powerfully than
ever.</p>

<p>The Play was conceived as a whole that ninth day.
The sun came warmly in, while he wrote at length of
the work, as he finally saw it.... On the tenth
day he drank a little milk and slept in his chair by the
doorway.... There was one difficult run that the
robin went over a hundred and fifty times, at least.</p>

<p class="ph2">19</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">B</span>etty Berry</span> watched the progress of the fasting
with a mothering intensity. She saw that
which had been lyrical and impassioned give way to the
workman, the deeper-seeing artist. He was not less
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>human; his humanity was broadened. From one of his
pages, she read how he had looked across at the higher
lights of New York one clear March night. His mind
had been suddenly startled by a swift picture of the
fighting fool he had been, and of the millions there,
beating themselves and each other to death for vain
things.... She saw his Play come on in the days
that followed the fasting. There was freshness in his
voice. She did not know that he had accepted death,
but she saw that he was beginning to accept her will in
their separation.</p>

<p>And this is what she had tried to bring about, but
her heart was breaking. Dully she wondered if her
whole life were not breaking. The something implacable
which she had always felt in being a woman, held her
like a matrix of iron now. Her life story had been a
classic of suffering, yet she had never suffered before.</p>

<p>A letter from him, (frequently twice a day, they
came) and it was her instant impulse to answer, almost
as if he had spoken. And when she wrote&mdash;all
the woman’s life of her had to be cut from it&mdash;cut again
and again&mdash;until was left only what another might say....
She was forced to learn the terrible process of
elimination which only the greater artists realize, and
which they learn only through years of travail&mdash;that
selection of the naked absolute, according to their vision,
all the senses chiseled away. His work, his health,
especially the clear-seeing that came from purifying of
the body, the detachment of his thoughts from physical
emotions&mdash;of these, which were clear to her as the impulses
of instinct&mdash;she allowed herself to write. But
the woman’s heart of flesh, which had fasted so long
for love, so often found its way to her pages, and forced
them to be done again.... Certain of his paragraphs
dismayed her, as:</p>

<p>“Does it astonish you,” he asked, almost joyously,
“when I say there is something about Betty Berry beyond<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
question&mdash;such a luxurious sense of truth?...
I feel your silences and your listenings between every
sentence. It is not what you say, though in words you
seem to know what I am to-day, and what I shall be
to-morrow&mdash;but all about the words, are <i>you</i>&mdash;those perfect
hesitations, the things which I seemed to know at
first, but could not express. They were much too fine
for a medium of expression which knew only wars,
horses, and the reporting of words and deeds of men....
Why, the best thing in my heart is its trust for
you, Betty Berry. Looking back upon our hours together,
I can see now that all the misunderstandings
were mine and all the truth yours. When it seems to me
that we should be together, and the memories come piling
back&mdash;those perfect hours&mdash;I say, because of this
trust, ‘Though it is not as I would have it, her way is
better. And I know I shall come to see it, because she
cannot be wrong.’”</p>

<p>So she could not hide her heart from him, even
though she put down what seemed to her unworthiness
and evasion, and decided through actual brain-process
what was best to say. A new conduct of life was not
carrying Betty Berry up into the coolness beyond the
senses. Fasting would never bring that to her. Fasting
of the body was so simple compared to the fasting
of the heart which had been her whole life. Nor could
she ever rise long from the sense of the serpent in woman
which she had realized from the words of his
Guardian&mdash;not a serpent to the usual man, but to the
man who was destined to love the many instead of one....
She loved him as a woman loves&mdash;the boy, the
lover, the man of him&mdash;the kisses, the whispers, the
arms of strength, the rapture of nearness....</p>

<p>He must have been close to the spirit of that night
at the theatre, when this was written:</p>

<p>“The letter to-day, with the plaintive note in it, has
brought you even closer. I never think of you as one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>who can be tried seriously; always as one finished, with
infinite patience, and no regard at all for the encompassing
common. Of course, I know differently, know that
you must suffer, you who are so keenly and exquisitely
animate&mdash;but you have an un-American poise....
You played amazingly. I loved that at once. There was
a gleam about it. Betty Berry’s gleaming. I faced you
from the wings that night. I wanted to come up behind
you. You were all music.... But I love even better
the instrument of emotions you have become. That
must be what music is for&mdash;to sensitize one’s life, to
make it more and more responsive....”</p>

<p>Then in a different vein:</p>

<p>“... The long forenoons, wherein we grow....
Yes, I knew you were a tree-lover; that the
sound of running water was dear to you ... and
the things you dream of ... work and play and
forest scents and the wind in the branches....
Sometimes it seems to me&mdash;is it a saying of lovers?&mdash;that
we should be boy and girl together.... Why,
I’ve only just now learned to be a boy. There was so
much of crudity and desire and anguish-to-do-greatly-at-any-cost&mdash;until
just a little ago. But I’ve never had a
boyhood that could have known you. I wasn’t ready for
such loveliness in the beginning.... I’ve wanted
terribly to go to you, but that is put away for the time.”</p>

<p>These lines wrung her heart. “Oh, no,” she cried,
“you have not learned how to become a boy. There was
never a time you were not ready&mdash;until now! You are
becoming a man&mdash;and the little girl&mdash;oh, she is a little
girl in her heart....”</p>

<p>Everything his Guardian had promised was coming
to be. He was changing into a man. That would take
him from her at the last&mdash;even letters, this torrent of
his thoughts of life and work. She saw the first process
of it&mdash;as the Play grasped him finally&mdash;the old tragedy
of a man turning from a woman to his work....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span></p>

<p>She built the play from the flying sparks....
He was thronged with illusions of production. How
badly he had done it before, he said, and how perfect
had proved the necessity to wait, and to do it a second
time.... Even the most unimaginative audience
must build the great battle picture from the headquarters
scene; then the trampled arena of the Ploughman, deep
in the hollow of that valley, and his coming forth through
the millet....</p>

<p>“... It’s so simple,” he wrote in fierce haste.
“You see, I remember how hard it was for me to grasp
that first night, when Fallows brought in the story to the
Russian headquarters.... I have remembered
that. I have made it <i>so that I could see it then</i>. And I
was woven in and fibred over with coarseness, from
months of life in Liaoyang and from the day’s hideous
brutality. I have measured my slowness and written to
quicken such slowness as that. The mystery is, it is not
spoiled by such clearness. It is better&mdash;it never lets you
alone. It won’t let you lie to yourself. You can’t be the
same after reading it.... And it goes after the
deepest down man.... Every line is involved in
action.</p>

<p>“The third act&mdash;sometime we’ll see it together&mdash;how
the main character leaves the field and goes out in search
of the Ploughman’s hut, across Asia and Europe; how
he reaches there&mdash;the old father and mother, the six
children, the one little boy, who has the particular answer
for the man’s lonely love&mdash;the mother of the six,
common, silent, angular, her skirt hanging square, as
Duke put it&mdash;but she is big enough for every one to get
into her heart. You will see the fear of her man’s
death, which the stranger’s presence brings to her, though
he leaves it to Russia to inform the family. You will see
the beautiful mystery of compassion that he brings, too.
That’s the whole shine of the piece. And it came from
the ministry of pain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span></p>

<p>... “I’m not praising <i>my</i> Play&mdash;it isn’t. It’s
Duke’s almost every word of it&mdash;every thought, the work
of Duke’s disciple. I have merely felt it all and made it
clear&mdash;clear. You see it all. Many thousands must see,
and see what the name means. It’s the most wonderful
word in the world to me, <i>Compassion</i>.”</p>

<p>Then came the break for a day, and the flash that
his work on the Play was finished. “The cabin will be
harder for me now. The new work is only a dream so
far&mdash;and this goes to Markheim to-day.... It is
very queer that I should go back to Markheim, but somehow
I want to pick up that failure. There are other
reasons.... I shall tell him that he can have five
days. I’m just getting ready to go across the River....
My health was almost never better. I’m not
tired. The work has seemed to replenish me, as your
letters do. But that last letter&mdash;yesterday’s&mdash;it seems
to come from behind a screen, where other voices were&mdash;the
loved tones troubled and crowded out by others. It
left me restless and more than ever longing to see you.
It is as if there were centuries all unintelligible, to be
made clear only by being with you. The world and the
other voices drown yours&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>She felt the instinct of centuries to hold out her arms
to him&mdash;arms of the woman, after man’s task in the
world&mdash;home at evening with the prize of the hunt and
battle. The world for the day, the woman for the night&mdash;that
is man’s way. She seemed to know it now from
past eternity. And for woman&mdash;day and night the man
of her thoughts.... She was afraid of her every
written word now. Her heart answered every thrill of
his; the murmuring and wrestling resistance of his
against the miles, was hers ten-fold.... The days
of the fasting had not been like this, nor the two weeks
that followed in which he had completed the play....
April had come. She was ill. Her music was
neglected altogether. Her friend, Helen Quiston, never
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>faltered in her conception of the beauty and the mystery
of the separation. With all her will, Helen sustained her
against the relinquishing of the lofty ideal of sacrifice,
and tried to distract her impassioned turning to the east....
She would hold to the death; Betty Berry knew
this.</p>

<p>“It’s harder now that the play is done,” Betty repeated.
“He can’t be driven instantly to work again. I
can’t lie to him. He doesn’t fight me&mdash;he thinks I’m
right&mdash;that’s the unspeakable part of it. There is nothing
for me to write about except his work....”</p>

<p>And Helen Quiston found her, a half-hour afterward,
staring out of the window, exactly as she had left&mdash;her
hands in her lap exactly the same.... Betty Berry
was thinking unutterable things, having to do with adorable
meetings in the theatre-wings&mdash;of wonderful night
journeys, all night talking&mdash;of waiting in a little room,
and at the head of the stairs. There was an invariable
coming back to the first kiss in the wings of the theatre.</p>

<p>“We were real&mdash;we were true to each other that
night&mdash;true as little children. We needed no words,”
this was her secret story.... “Oh, I waited so
long for him ... and we could have gone out together
and served in a little way. But they would not
let us alone.”</p>

<p>He had been across to New York.... The
second morning after the play was finished, she received
a letter with a rather indescribable ending. He told her
of fears and strangeness, of intolerable longing for something
to happen that would bring them together.... The rest is here:</p>

<p>“I’m a bit excited by the thought that just came to
me. And another, but I won’t tell you yet, for fear....
I don’t quite understand myself. I seem afraid.
I think I would ask more of myself than I would of
another man just now. There seem all about me invisible
restraints. Something deep within recognizes the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>greatness and finality of your meaning to me....
It is true, you do not leave the strength to me. Did you
ever&mdash;? No, I won’t ask that.... This letter isn’t
kind to you&mdash;unsettling, strange, full of an intensity to
see and be with you....”</p>

<p>Moments afterwards, as she was standing at the
piano&mdash;the letter trailing from her hand&mdash;the telephone
in the inner room startled her like a human cry.</p>

<p class="ph2">20</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">I</span>t</span> was Morning. She did not remember his words nor
her answers&mdash;only that she had told him he might
come up-town to her. He had dropped the receiver then,
as if it burned him.</p>

<p>So, it was a matter of minutes. Nothing was ready.
Least of all, was she ready. She could hardly stand.
She had forgotten at first, and it had required courage,
of late, to look in the mirror. She would have given up,
before what she saw now, but a robin was singing in
the foliage by the rear windows. She went out to open
the studio door into the hall, then retired to the inner
room again.... “He can heal you, and bring back
the music,” her heart whispered, but her mind cowered
before herself, and this mate of herself, Helen Quiston,
and before his Guardian.... She heard his step
on the stair ... called to him to wait in the studio.
He was pacing to and fro.</p>

<p>Morning felt the light resistance in her arms. His
kiss fell upon her cheek. He held her at arm’s length,
looking into her face.</p>

<p>She laughed, repeating that she was not ill....
She was always thinner in summer, she said. In her
withholding, there was destructiveness for the zeal he
had brought; and that which she set herself resolutely
to impart&mdash;the sense of their separateness&mdash;found its
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>lodgment in his nature. It would always be there now,
she thought; it would augment, like ice about a spring
in early winter, until the frost sealed the running altogether.
The lover was stayed, though his mind would
not yet believe.</p>

<p>“Is it really possible,” he said, sitting before her restlessly,
“that I am here in your house, and that I can stay,
and talk with you, and see you and hear you play? I
have thought about it so much that it’s hard to realize.”</p>

<p>“It is quite what a lover would say,” she thought....
She had to watch her words. Her heart went
out to him, but her mind remembered the work to do....
Self-consciousness, and a weighing of words&mdash;how
horrible between <i>them</i>!</p>

<p>“And what made you come? I had just read your
letter, when the telephone rang&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t have sent that letter,” he answered. “I
must have sent it because of the things I thought, and
didn’t write.... The night before, I had come home
to the cabin&mdash;after Markheim and the city. It was
dreadful&mdash;with the work gone. Yesterday was too much
for me&mdash;the Spring day&mdash;alone&mdash;not ready to begin
again&mdash;you here.... I got to thinking about you
so fast&mdash;and the shame of it, for us to be apart&mdash;that
I couldn’t endure it.... I thought of going to
you in a month&mdash;in a week; and then when the
letter was mailed, I thought of it being with you this
morning.... A thousand things poured into my
mind. It seemed finally as if everything was wrong between
us; as if I had already remained too long from
you. It was like fighting devils.... And then I
tried to beat the letter to you, but it got here by an
earlier train this morning.”</p>

<p>He was like a child to her, telling about something
that had frightened him.</p>

<p>Their silences were strained. His eyes had a sleepless
look. Betty saw it working upon him&mdash;the repulsion
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>that had gone from her. She wished she might go to
his arms and die. It suddenly came over her&mdash;the uselessness
of it all&mdash;the uselessness of being a woman, of
waiting, of final comprehension&mdash;all for this rending....
Yet she saw what would happen if she followed
her heart. He would take her. There would be a radiant
season, for the lover within him was not less because
his work was for other men. But there was also
within him (his Guardian had made her believe it) her
rival, a solitary stranger come to the world for service,
who would not delay long to show him how he had betrayed
his real work, how he had caged his greater self,
his splendid pinions useless.... Morning would
hear the world calling for work he could not do.</p>

<p>“<i>There seem all about me invisible restraints.</i>”</p>

<p>This from the letter of the morning&mdash;alone remained
with her. It expressed it all. The sentence uprose in
her mind. It was more dominant to her than if a father
had forbade his coming, or even if by his coming another
was violated.</p>

<p>All the forbiddings that Society can bring against
desire are but symbols compared to the invisible restraints
of a full man’s nature. Men who are held by
symbols, ruled by exterior voices and fears, are not finished
enough to be a law unto themselves.... It
wasn’t the terror of these thoughts, but tenderness in
answer to his hurried tumble of explanation regarding
his coming, that had filled Betty’s eyes. He caught the
sparkle of a tear in profile, and came to her.</p>

<p>“It’s like creating&mdash;visibly, without hands, but with
thoughts&mdash;creating a masterpiece&mdash;to see the tears come
like that&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He drew a chair to the bench where she sat, her back
to the piano. Helen Quiston was away, as usual, for the
forenoon.</p>

<p>“It is creating&mdash;another world,” she answered
steadily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span></p>

<p>He stared at her. She saw again that sleepless look.</p>

<p>“You’ve been a whole month on a lofty ridge&mdash;just
think of it&mdash;fasting and pure expression of self&mdash;spiritual
self-revelation&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>It seemed to him there was a suggestion in what she
said for the new book.</p>

<p>“And now you are down in the meadows again,” she
finished.</p>

<p>“The earth-sweet meadows&mdash;with you.”</p>

<p>He could not know what the words meant to her;
that there was no quarter in them for her. She did not
belong to his ascents.</p>

<p>“Somehow I always think of you as belonging best
to the evenings, the hushed earth, the sweetness of the
rest-time. You make me remember what to do, and how
to do it well. Why, just now you made me see clearly
for a second what I must do next. You make me love
people better&mdash;when I am close to you.”</p>

<p>She was not to be carried away by these givings
which would have made many a woman content.</p>

<p>“Remember, I have had your letters every day. You
are very dear to me up there. You have been down in
the meadows&mdash;and in the caverns&mdash;much. You are not
ready to return&mdash;even for the evenings. You stand now
for austere purity&mdash;for plain, ancient, mother’s knee
ideals. You must not delude yourself. A man must be
apart in order to see. You did not begin really to live&mdash;until
you drew apart.”</p>

<p>He felt her stripping his heart. His face lifted in
agony, and his eyes caught the picture on the wall of
the meeting of Beatrice and Dante. The Florentine
woman seemed not to touch the earth; the poet was
awed, mystic in the fusion of their united powers. It
was fateful that Morning saw the picture at this instant.</p>

<p>“Look,” he said, “what the world has from the meeting
of that man and woman&mdash;an immortal poem!”</p>

<p>“But Beatrice passed on&mdash;&mdash;”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span></p>
<p>“She became identified with his greater power, Betty.
She was one with it&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“By passing on!”</p>

<p>He arose and lifted her to her feet, and his arms did
not relinquish her.</p>

<p>“And you mean that you would pass on?... You
must not. You must not. We would both be broken
and bewildered. I love you. I have come to you. I
want to be near&mdash;and work with you. I know you all,
and shall love you always. I have come to you, and
I must stay&mdash;or you must come with me&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Her resistance was broken for the moment. An icy
burden fell from her. She clung to him, and tears helped
her.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>They were together again in the studio that afternoon.
Betty Berry was making tea, her strength renewed.
Helen Quiston had come and gone. Morning
had been away for an hour.</p>

<p>“Strange man,” she said, “let us reason together....
You are working now for men. That is right,
but when you are full of power, when you come really
into the finished man you are to be, and all these hard
years have healed beyond the last ache&mdash;you will work
for women. Does it sound strange from me, that the
inspiration of the world to-day is with the women?
Why, it seems to me that men are caught in the very
science of cruelty. And then, the women of to-day represent
the men of the future. When one of the preparers
of the way brings his gospel to women, he kindles
the inspiration of the next generation. But this fire can
only come from the solitary heights&mdash;never from the
earth-sweet meadows&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>“The men who have done the most beautiful verses
and stories about children&mdash;have had no children of their
own. A man cannot be the father of his country and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>the father of a house. The man who must do the greatest
work for women must hunger for the <i>vision</i> of
Woman, and not be yoked with one.... It is so
clear. It is always so.”</p>

<p>“All that you say makes me love you more,
Betty&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Don’t, dear. Don’t make it harder for me....
It is not I that thrills you. It is my speaking of your
work that fills your heart with gladness&mdash;the things you
feel to do&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“They are from you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Don’t say that. It is not true.”</p>

<p>“But I never saw so clearly&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Then go away with the vision. Oh, John Morning,
you cannot listen to yourself&mdash;with a woman in the
room!”</p>

<p>He lifted his shoulders, drawing her face to his. “I
was going to say, you are my wings,” he whispered.
“But that is not it. You are my fountain. I would
come to you and drink&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But not remain&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I love your thoughts, Betty, your eyes and lips&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Because you are athirst&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I shall always be athirst!”</p>

<p>“That is not nature.”</p>

<p>He shuddered.</p>

<p>“Do men, however athirst&mdash;remain at the oases?
Men of strength&mdash;would they not long to go? Would
they not remember the far cities and the long, blinding
ways of the sun?”</p>

<p>“But you could go with me&mdash;” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“That is not nature!”</p>

<p>He was the weaker. “But you have gone alone to
the far cities, and the long, blinding ways of the
sun&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, alone. But with you&mdash;a time would come
when I could not. We are man and woman. There
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>would be little children. I would stay&mdash;and you could
not leave them.... Oh, they are not for you, dear.
They would weaken your courage. You would love
them. At the end of the day, you would want them,
and the mother again.... The far cities would not
hear you; the long, blinding ways of the sun would
know you no more&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Betty,” he whispered passionately, “how wonderfully
sweet that would be!”</p>

<p>“Yes ... to the mother ... but <i>you</i>&mdash;I
can see it in your eyes. You would remember Nineveh,
that great city....”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Darkness was about them.</p>

<p>“Betty Berry&mdash;you would rather I wouldn’t take the
train to you again&mdash;not even when it seems I cannot stay
longer away?”</p>

<p>She did not answer.</p>

<p>“Betty&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes....”</p>

<p>She left him and crossed to the far window.</p>

<p>“Would you not have me come to you again&mdash;at
all?”</p>

<p>She could not hold the sentence, and her answer.
The room was terrible. It seemed filled with presences
that suffocated her&mdash;that cared nothing for her. All day
they had inspired her to speak and answer&mdash;and now
they wanted her death. She moved to the ’cello. Her
hands fluttered along the strings&mdash;old, familiar ways&mdash;but
making hardly a sound.... If she did not soon
speak, he would come to her. She would fail again&mdash;the
touch of him, and she would fail.</p>

<p>“Betty, is there never to be&mdash;the fountain at evening?”</p>

<p>“You know&mdash;you know&mdash;” she cried out. Words
stuck after that. She had not a thought to drive them.</p>

<p>He arose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span></p>

<p>“Don’t,” she implored. “Don’t come to me! I cannot
bear it.”</p>

<p>... It was his final rebellion.</p>

<p>“I am not a preparer of the way. I have not a message.
I am sick of the thought. I am just a man&mdash;and
I love you!”</p>

<p>At last she made her stand, and on a different position.
“I could not love you&mdash;if that were true.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>She heard him speak, but not the words. She heard
the crackling and whirring of flames. He did not cross
the room.... She had risen, her arms groping toward
him. She felt him approach, and the flames were
farther.... She must not speak of flames.</p>

<p>“You will go away soon&mdash;won’t you?” she whispered,
as he took her.</p>

<p>“Yes, to-night&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;to-night,” she repeated.</p>

<p>She was lying upon the couch in the studio, and his
chair was beside her.</p>

<p>“No, don’t light anything&mdash;no light!... It is
just an hour.... I could not think of food until
you go. But you may bring me a drink of water. On the
way to the train, you can have your supper.... I
will play&mdash;play in the dark, and think of you&mdash;as you
go&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>She talked evenly, a pause between sentences. There
was a tensity in the formation of words, for the whirring
and crackling distracted, dismayed her. Her heart
was breaking. This she knew. When it was finished,
he would be free.... The flames were louder and
nearer, as he left for the drink of water. She called
to him to light a match, if he wished, in the other room....
He was in her room. She knew each step, just
where. He was there. It was as if he were finally materialized
from her thoughts in the night, her dreaming
and writing to him. His hand touched her dresser. She
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>heard the running water ... and then it was all
red and rending and breathless, until she felt the water
to her lips. Always, as he came near, the flames receded.</p>

<p>And out of all the chaos, the figure of the craftsman
had returned to him. The world had revealed itself to
him as never before in the passage of time. She had
given him her very spirit that day, and the strength of all
her volition from the month of brooding upon the conception
of his Guardian. Literally on that day the new
Book was conceived, as many a man’s valorous work
has begun to be, in a woman’s house&mdash;her blood and
spirit, its bounty.</p>

<p>“This is a holy place to me, this room,” he said, the
agonies of silence broken. “I can feel the white floods
of spirit that drive the world.”</p>

<p>She did not need to answer. She held fast to herself,
lest something betray her. Darkness was salvation.
All that his Guardian had asked was in her work. John
Morning told it off, sentence by sentence. It took her
life, but he must not know. She thought she would
die immediately after he was gone&mdash;but, strangely, now
the suffering was abated.... She was helping....
Was not that the meaning of life&mdash;to give, to
help, to love?... Someone had said so.</p>

<p>He lifted her, carried her in his arms, talked and
praised her.</p>

<p>“There’s something deathlessly bright about you,
Betty Berry!” he whispered. “I am going&mdash;but we are
one! Don’t you feel it? You are loving the world from
my heart!”</p>

<p>To the door, but not to the light, she walked with
him.... Up the stairs he strode a last time to take
her in his arms.</p>

<p>“We are one&mdash;a world-loving one&mdash;remember that!”</p>

<p>She did not know why, but as he kissed her&mdash;she
thought of the pitcher broken at the fountain.</p>

<p>It was all strange light and singing flame....
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235-8]</span>She was lost in the hall. She laughed strangely....
She must play him on his way.... Someone helped
her through the raining light&mdash;until she could feel the
strings.</p>

THE BARE-HEADED MAN</h2></div>

<p class="ph2">1</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> red head of the little telephone-miss bowed
over the switch-board when Morning entered
Markheim’s. She colored, smiled; all metropolitan outrages
of service forgotten. Charley waved furtively
from afar; the door to the inner office opened.</p>

<p>“Well?” said the manager.</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Markheim?”</p>

<p>“You have come too soon.”</p>

<p>“I said&mdash;five days.”</p>

<p>“We read no play in five days.”</p>

<p>“It was left here on that basis.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense.”</p>

<p>“You can give it to me now.”</p>

<p>“It is being read now. Your title is rotten. The old
one was better.”</p>

<p>“That title will grow on you,” said Morning, who
began to like the interview. “I shall come to take the
play to-morrow&mdash;unless you decide to keep it and bring
it out this Fall&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Why did you come to Markheim again? Have you
tried all the rest?”</p>

<p>“There was something unfinished about our former
brush&mdash;I didn’t like the feel of it.... My play is
done over better. Neither copy has been submitted&mdash;except
to Markheim.”</p>

<p>“Your play may be as bad as before.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span></p>

<p>“Yes. It looks better to me, however.”</p>

<p>“You’ve got a war play again&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That first and second act.”</p>

<p>“You can’t write war. This is not war&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Morning did not realize the change that had come
over him until he recalled the shame and rebellion that
had risen in his mind when Markheim had said this before....
Something had come to him from Duke
Fallows, or from Betty Berry, or from the hill silences.
He was a new creature.... Must one be detached
somewhat from the world in order to use it? This was
his sense at the moment: that he could compel the mind
before him, reinforced as it was by distaste for everything
decent, and manifesting the opinions of other men,
including Reever Kennard’s. There was no irritation
whatsoever; no pride in being a war-writer, good or
bad. Markheim’s denial had no significance in the world
above or water beneath. He saw, however, that he must
change Markheim’s idea, and that he must do it by
beating Markheim in his own particular zone of activity.</p>

<p>There was a certain fun in this. He arose and stood
by the other’s chair. The eye-balls showed wider and
rolled heavily. The pistol or bomb was never far from
his mind. Morning looked down at him, saying quietly:</p>

<p>“You said something like that before, and it wasn’t
your opinion&mdash;it was Reever Kennard’s. I don’t object
to it exactly, but I want to show you something. You
know Reever Kennard’s paper?”</p>

<p>Markheim nodded.</p>

<p>“You know the <i>World-News</i> sent him out to the
Russo-Japanese war&mdash;big expense account, helpers,
dress-suits, and all that?”</p>

<p>“I know he was there.”</p>

<p>“The same managing editor who sent Reever Kennard
out is still on the desk. He should be in the office
now. The number is&mdash;&mdash;”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span></p>
<p>Morning found it for him hastily, and added: “You
call him now.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to call him up&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But you’d better. Twice you said something that
someone told you&mdash;and it’s troublesome. The short way
out is to call him now&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Morning was tapping the desk lightly. Markheim
reached for the extension ’phone. Luckily, the thing
was managed&mdash;luckily, and through the name of Markheim.</p>

<p>“Ask him who did the story of the battle of Liaoyang
for the <i>World-News</i>?” Morning ordered.</p>

<p>The question was asked and the answer came back.</p>

<p>“Ask him if it was a good story&mdash;and how long.”</p>

<p>It was asked and answered.</p>

<p>“Ask him if it was conceded to be the best story of
the war published in America.”</p>

<p>The talk was extended this time, Markheim explaining
why he asked.</p>

<p>“What did he say?” Morning asked.</p>

<p>“He said it was all right,” Markheim granted pertly.
“Only that there was a very good story from another
man on Port Arthur&mdash;afterward.”</p>

<p>“That is true. There was a heady little chap got
into Port Arthur&mdash;and came out strong.... Now,
look here&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Morning went to the case where a particularly recent
encyclopædia was drawn forth. He referred to the war,
but especially to the final paragraph of the article, captioned
“Bibliography.”... His own name and the
name of his book was cited as the principal American
reference.... It was all laughable. No one knew
better than Morning that such action would be silly
among real people.</p>

<p>“You don’t see Reever Kennard referred to, do you&mdash;as
authority of war-stuff?... The point is that
you play people get so much counterfeit color and office-setting&mdash;that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
you naturally can’t look authoritatively on
the real thing.... However, the fact that I know
more about the battle of Liaoyang than any other man
in America would never make a good play. There’s a
lot beside in this play&mdash;a lot more than at first&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“They have your play out now&mdash;reading it,” Markheim
observed.</p>

<p>Morning added: “It’s clear to you, isn’t it, why Mr.
Reever Kennard didn’t care for the John Morning
play&mdash;&mdash;?”</p>

<p>Markheim’s eyes gleamed. This was pure business.
“You had the goods and delivered it in his own
office&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Exactly&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You bother me too much about this play. The title
is rotten&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You’ll like that, when you see Markheim with it.
There’s a peculiar thing about the word&mdash;it doesn’t die.
It never rests. It’s human&mdash;divine, too. There’s a cry
in it&mdash;to some happiness, to some sorrow&mdash;to the many,
hope.... It sings. I would rather have it than
glory.... Listen, ‘<i>Markheim Offers Compassion</i>’&mdash;why,
that’s a God’s business&mdash;offering compassion&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You feel like a song-bird this afternoon, Mr. Morning&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I’ll be back to-morrow&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Too soon&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Can’t help it. It’s ready. It will be the big word
this Winter. You can read it in an hour. I’m off to-morrow&mdash;from
Markheim. The Winter will clear my
slate in this office, whether you take it or not&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Come back at noon&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Charley’s sister looked up from her pad. Her swift
change of expression to a certain shyness and pleasure,
too, in a sort of mutual secret, added to Morning’s merriment
as he left the building.... He wondered continually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
that afternoon what had come over him. He
had not been able to do this sort of thing before. The
astonishing thing was his detachment from any tensity
of interest. It was all right either way, according to
his condition of mind. The question was important:
Must a man be aloof from the fogging ruck of accepted
activities in order to see them, and to manage best
among things as they are?</p>

<p>There was the new book, too. Betty Berry had given
him the new task. A splendor had come to life&mdash;even
with the unspeakable sadness of the ending of that day.
The beauty of that day would never die. Every phase
of her sacrifice revealed a subtle, almost superhuman,
faith in him. Was it this&mdash;her faith in him&mdash;that made
him so new and so strong; that made him know in his
heart that if the Play were right&mdash;it would go in spite
of Markheim, in spite of all New York? And if it
were not right, certainly he did not want it to go....
Markheim and New York&mdash;he regarded them that night
from his doorstep; then turned his back to the city, and
faced the west and the woman.</p>

<p>It broke upon him. She was mothering him. She
was bringing to his action all that was real and powerful&mdash;fighting
for it, against every desire and passion of her
own. Her wish for his good was superior to her own
wish for happiness. She gave him his work and his
dreams. He knew not what mystery of prayer and concentration
she poured upon him.... This place in
which she had never been was filled with her. The little
frail creature was playing upon him, as upon her instrument.
Moments were his in which she seemed a mighty
artist.</p>

<p>And then he saw men everywhere&mdash;just instruments&mdash;but
played upon by forces of discord and illusion....
He saw these men clearly, because he had been
of them. Such forces had played upon him....
He had been buffeted and whipped along the rough ways.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>He had looked up to the slaughterers of the wars as
unto men of greatness. He had been played upon by
the thirsts and the sufferings, by greed and ambition. He
had hated men. He had fumed at bay before imagined
wrongs; and yet no one had nor could wrong him, but
himself.</p>

<p>One by one he had been forced to fight it out with
his own devils&mdash;to the last ditch. There they had quit&mdash;vanished
like puffs of nasty smoke. He had stood beneath
Reever Kennard, almost poisoning himself to
death with hatred. Pure acknowledgment this, that his
life moved in the same scope of evil.... He had
accepted the power of Markheim, feared it, and suffered
over the display of it. Now he found it puny and
laughable. He had worked for himself, and it had
brought him only madness and shattering of force. He
had been brought to death, had accepted it in its most
hideous form&mdash;and risen over it.... His hill was
calm and sweet in the dusk. Though his heart was
lonely&mdash;and though all this clear-seeing seemed not so
wonderful as it would be to have the woman with him
in the cabin&mdash;yet it was all very good. He felt strong,
his fighting force not abated.</p>

<p>He had his work. She had shown him that. He
would write every line to her. His work would lift him
up, as the days of the Play had lifted him&mdash;out of the
senses and the usual needs of man. He would be with
her, in that finer communion of instrument and artist....
The world was very old and dear. Men’s hearts
were troubled, but men’s evils were very trifling, when
all was understood. He would never forget his lessons.
He would tell everyone what miracles are performed in
the ministry of pain.... He looked into the dark
of the west and loved her.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“Well, you are on time,” said Markheim the following
noon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span></p>

<p>“Yes,” Morning said with calmness and cheer.</p>

<p>“We will take the play. I have had it read....
We can do no more than bust.”</p>

<p>“This Fall&mdash;the production?”</p>

<p>“I will give it the <i>Markheim</i> in November.”</p>

<p>He seemed to be surprised that Morning did not
emotionalize in some way. He had expected at least to
be informed that “bust” was out of the question, and
missed this mannerism of the playwright, now that the
thing was his and not the other’s.... Moreover,
Markheim was pleased with the way he had reached the
decision. He wanted Morning to know.</p>

<p>“There was that difference of opinion.... Do
you know what I did?”</p>

<p>Morning couldn’t imagine.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Markheim, sitting back, hands patting
his girth, “those who have nothing but opinions&mdash;read
your play. They like it; they like it not. It will pay.
It will not pay. It is ‘revolutionary,’ ‘artistic,’ ‘well-knit,’
‘good second act’&mdash;much rot it is, and is not. Who
do you think settled the question?”</p>

<p>“Yourself?”</p>

<p>“Not me&mdash;I have no opinion.”</p>

<p>“Who then?”</p>

<p>“The friend of no man.” It was said with grandeur.</p>

<p>Morning waited.</p>

<p>Markheim leaned forward, beaming not unkindly,
and whispered:</p>

<p>“The little one at the switch-board outside the door.
She said it was ‘lovely.’... Oh, she’s a sharp little
spider.”</p>

<p class="ph2">2</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">H</span>ere</span> is an extra bit of the fabric, that goes along
with the garment for mending.... Mid-May,
and never a sign of the old wound’s reopening.
Something of Morning’s former robustness had spent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>itself, but he had all the strength a man needs, and that
light unconsciousness of the flesh which is delightful to
those who produce much from within. The balance of
his forces of development had turned from restoring his
body to a higher replenishment.</p>

<p>The mystery of work broke upon him more and
more, and the thrall of it; its relation to man at his best;
the cleansing of a man’s daily life for the improvement
of his particular expression in the world’s service; the
ordering of his daily life in pure-mindedness, the power
of the will habitually turned to the achieving of this
pure-mindedness. He saw that man is only true and at
peace when played upon from the spiritual source of
life; therefore, all that perfects a man’s instrumentation
is vital, and all that does not is destructive. Most important
of all, he perceived that a real worker has nothing
whatever to do beyond the daily need, with the result
of his work in a worldly way; that any deep relation to
worldly results of a man’s work is contamination.</p>

<p>He lost the habit and inclination to think what he
wanted to say. He listened. He became sceptical of
all work that came from brain, in the sense of having
its origin in something he had actually learned. He remembered
how Fallows had spoken of this long ago;
(he had not listened truly enough to understand then);
how a man’s brain is at his best when used purely to
receive&mdash;as a little finer instrument than the typewriter.</p>

<p>Except for certain moments on the borderland of
sleep, Betty Berry was closest to him during his work.
His every page was for her eye&mdash;a beloved revelation
of his flesh and mind and spirit. And the thing had to
be plain, plain, plain. That was the law.</p>

<p>How Fallows had fought for that. “Don’t forget the
deepest down man, John!”... Betty Berry and
Fallows and Nevin were his angels&mdash;his cabin, a place of
continual outpouring to them. Few evils were powerful
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>enough to stem such a current, and penetrate the gladness
of giving.</p>

<p>He slept lightly, and was on the verge again and
again, almost nightly, in fact, of surprising his own
greater activity that does not sleep. He often brought
back just the murmur of these larger doings; and on
the borderlands he sometimes felt himself in the throb
of that larger consciousness which moves about its meditations
and voyagings, saying to the body, “Sleep on.”
It was this larger consciousness that used him as he
used the typewriter, when he was writing at his best and
his listening was pure.... He had been held so
long to the ruck that he would never forget the parlance
of the people&mdash;and not fall to writing for visionaries.</p>

<p>... One night he dreamed he went to Betty
Berry.... He was ascending the stairs to her.
She seemed smaller, frailer. Though he was a step or
two down, his eyes met hers equally. She was lovelier
than anything he had ever known or conceived in
woman. Her smile was so wistful and sweet and compassionate&mdash;that
the hush and fervor of it seemed everywhere
in the world. There was a shyness in her lips
and in the turn of her head. Some soft single garment
was about her&mdash;as if she had come from a fountain in
the evening.... And suddenly there was a great
tumult within him. He was lost in the battle of two
selves&mdash;the man who loved and destroyed, and the man
who loved and sustained.</p>

<p>The greater love only asked her there&mdash;loved her
there, exquisite, apart, found in her a theme for infinite
contemplation, as she stood smiling.... The other
was the love of David, when he looked across the house-tops
at Bathsheba, bathing, and made her a widow to
mother Solomon. This human love was strong in the
dream, for he caught her in his arms, and kissed, and
would not let her go, until her voice at last reached his

<p>“<i>Oh, why did you spoil it all? Oh, why&mdash;when I
thought it was safe to come?</i>”</p>

<p>He had no words, but her message was not quite
ended:</p>

<p>“<i>I should have come to you as before&mdash;and not this
way&mdash;but you seemed so strong and so pure....
It is my fault&mdash;all my fault.</i>”</p>

<p>She was Betty Berry&mdash;but lovelier than all the earth&mdash;the
spirit of all his ideals in woman. The marvelous
thing about it was that he knew after the dream that
this was the Betty Berry that would live in spite of anything
that could happen to the Betty Berry in the world.
He knew that she waited for him&mdash;for the greater lover,
John Morning, whose love did not destroy, but sustained....
She who regarded him in “the hush of
expectancy” from the distance of a night’s journey, and
he who labored here stoutly in the work of the world,
were but names and symbols of the real creatures above
the illusion of time.... So he came to love death&mdash;not
with eagerness, but as an ideal consummation.
Such a result were impossible had he not faced
death as an empty darkness first, and overcome the fear
of it.</p>

<p>These many preparations for real life on earth in the
flesh he was to put in his book&mdash;not his adventures, but
the fruits of them&mdash;how he had reached to-day, and its
decent polarity in service. He had been hurled like a
top into the midst of men. After the seething of wild
energy and the wobblings, he had risen to a certain singing
and aspiring rhythm&mdash;the whir of harmony. He
told the story in order, day by day. Though it was done
with the I’s, there was no self-exploitation. John Morning
was merely the test-tube, containing from time to
time different compounds of experience. And he did it
plainly, plainly, plainly, as is the writer’s business.</p>

<p>As he watched for Jethro, one morning early in June,
he perceived a second figure in the old rig. At the box,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>the stranger got out and followed Jethro’s arm, directed
up the hill toward the cabin, disappeared for a moment
in the swail-thicket by the fence, and presently began
the ascent, bringing Morning’s papers and letters....
The stranger was tall and tanned, wore a wide
hat and approached with a slim ease of movement.
Morning knew he had seen him before, but could not
remember until the voice called:</p>

<p>“Hullo&mdash;that you, John Morning?”</p>

<p>It was Archibald Calvert, last met during the night-halt
in Rosario, Luzon, the correspondent who had ridden
with Reever Kennard, and who had lost <i>Mio Amigo</i>.
He had always thought rather pleasantly of Archibald
Calvert when he thought at all.</p>

<p>“Say&mdash;what are you getting set for out here?”</p>

<p>“It’s better and cheaper than a hall-bedroom,” Morning
answered.</p>

<p>“That sounds good.... Well, I spent all day
yesterday looking for you&mdash;first clue, Boabdil&mdash;second at
Markheim’s from a little red-haired girl.... The
rural man picked me up&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I’ve got some cold buttermilk&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Pure asceticism&mdash;also a pearl of an idea&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>They sat down together.</p>

<p>“So you made ten thousand dollars out of Liaoyang
after you came back.... I looked up the story.
It was&mdash;say, it was a bride, Morning!”</p>

<p>“Thanks. Duke Fallows did a better one in one-tenth
the space. The pay-end didn’t mean much. I’m
not a good bed for money culture. Tell me where you’ve
been, Mr. Calvert.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve been around. Didn’t get up to the Russ-Jap
stuff. I was down among the Pacific Islands. You
know I’m a better tramp than writer. It’s five years
since I hit New York.... They say old Reever
Kennard is doing politics. He’ll be back from Washington
to-night&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span></p>

<p>“Politics, and an occasional dramatic criticism,” said
Morning.</p>

<p>“You know that never sat easy&mdash;that day in Rosario&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Didn’t it?”</p>

<p>“I was down to Batangas three days later&mdash;unpacking
saddle-bags, and found <i>Mio Amigo</i> No. 1. Deeper
down I found its mate.... They’re common in
Luzon as old Barlow knives when we were kids....
I made a scene about that knife&mdash;with my own deep
down in my own duffel.... I suppose you’ve forgotten.”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;I haven’t.”</p>

<p>“You were pretty decent about it. It was a nasty thing&mdash;even
to speak about it as I did. You see, the inscription
rather appealed to kid-intelligence in my case, and I
thought it was unique, instead of the popular idea of a
cheap Filipino knife.”</p>

<p>“Kennard took it seriously, didn’t he?” said Morning.</p>

<p>“You mean at the time?... Yes, I couldn’t understand
that exactly.”</p>

<p>Morning decided not to speak of that day’s relation
to Tokyo five years later.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Calvert, after a pause, “I hunted you up
to say I was an ass, and to give you back your knife.
The pair have been smelling up my things around the
world for a long time.”</p>

<p>Morning grasped it eagerly.</p>

<p>Some time afterward, when Calvert arose to go,
Morning ventured this much:</p>

<p>“And so you’re going to see Reever Kennard?”</p>

<p>“Yes, to-night.... I suppose you two and the
others game together from time to time?”</p>

<p>“The fact is, New York isn’t very good anchorage
for that sort of thing,” Morning said.</p>

<p>“... I was glad when they told me you had put
over that big Liaoyang stuff, Morning&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span></p>

<p>Morning smiled and took the quick brown hand of the
other. Calvert appealed to him, but it couldn’t be
shown in any way. Calvert was like a good horse,
gladly giving evidence of fine feeling, but embarrassed
when made much of.... He went away blithely&mdash;off,
for God knows where&mdash;but fearlessly on his
way.</p>

<p>Morning held the little knife in his hand.</p>

<p>He thought of that hard Philippine service which had
seemed so big at the time; of that day when he watched
the fat shoulders of Reever Kennard in the forward sets
of horse, Kennard seeming all that greatness can be. He
thought of the halt in Rosario, of the lame woman. He
looked at the little knife again.... He had not
really wanted it then, and yet it had cut the strings of
his Fates, turning them loose upon him. It had knocked
him out of the second Japanese column five years afterward,
and given him instead Duke Fallows and Liaoyang.
It had given him that great battle, Lowenkampf,
the Ploughman, Eve, the sorrel mare&mdash;the journey to
Koupangtse&mdash;the blanket at Tongu&mdash;the deck-passage&mdash;the
<i>Sickles</i>, Ferry&mdash;and Nevin&mdash;even Noyes and
Field.</p>

<p>It had given him the Armory, and Betty Berry.</p>

<p>He held it fast.</p>

<p>It had given him money, fame, and New York for a
day&mdash;the opinion from Kennard that killed the first writing
of <i>Compassion</i>&mdash;the mood to see Charley and his sister
at the switch-board, which brought him to Betty
Berry again.... Out of these had come all that
was real and true of this hour. It had given him the
slums and the leper conflict&mdash;Nevin’s cure and the fasting&mdash;the
real Ploughman&mdash;the better <i>Compassion</i>&mdash;the
cabin in which he sat, his place of Initiation. It had
given him the triumph over death&mdash;the illumination of
love and labor&mdash;the listening life of the soul, and the
vision of its superb immortality.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span></p>
<p>He held it fast and looked hard at the little friend.
The brass handle sent up a smell of verdi-gris from his
hot hand.</p>

<p class="ph2">3</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>his</span> was John Morning’s splendid summer. He
was up often at two or three in the morning.
Thoughts and sentences of yesterday, now cleared and
improved, thronged his mind, as he made coffee. He
learned that a man may write the first half of a book,
but be used as a mere slave of the last half. And yet,
to be the instrument of a rush of life and ideas, the latter
becoming every hour more coherent and effective,
was a privilege to make a man sing. And to increase,
at the same time, in the realization of the courage and
tenderness and faith of a woman who waited; to feel the
power of her in the work; to work for her; to put his
love for her in the work, all the strength of her attraction&mdash;this
was living the life of depth and fullness.</p>

<p>Times when he looked out of the doorway, and the
elms were shaping against the flowery purple of daybreak,
and the robin beginning thirstily&mdash;his eyes
smarted with tears at the beauty of it all, the privilege
of work, and the absolute rightness of the whole creation,
in which a man can’t possibly lose, after he has
heard his real self speak. He loved life and death in
such moments, and knew there was a Betty Berry in the
waiting studio, and another over the Crossing. (Had
he not glimpsed her in his dream at the top of the stairway?)</p>

<p>So his book prospered, enfolding the common man.
It had something for every man who had not come so
far as he. He was <i>of</i> them, in every understanding
among them, different only in that it was his business to
write by the way. His old failures furnished the studies
of distintegrating forces. Personally, he was detached
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>from them, as his writing showed, except for an intellectual
familiarity&mdash;as detached as from the worn clothing
he had left here and there around the world. One
by one, the constructive and destructive principles of the
average man were shown divided against each other in
the arena of mind&mdash;and how the friends and loves had
come to the balance. Nevin was in the fabric, the little
Englishman at Tongu, Fallows and the Woman&mdash;not in
name, (there was no name but John Morning’s), but
they were all there, lifting and laughing and drawing,
as friends and loves do in the life of a man. Again and
again he cried out that the peace and sweet reason of
things he had found was of their bringing&mdash;that without
them he would have been lost again and again by
the way.</p>

<p>... The Summer days passed magically. Markheim
was beginning to talk rehearsals. He had found
the right man to play the Ploughman.... Late-September.
The letters from Betty Berry were rarer,
thinner. They troubled him.... One morning he
watched Jethro’s rig approach&mdash;a golden morning, and
the cattle were feeding down in the meadow. He had
seen the picture a thousand times&mdash;the cattle on the slope&mdash;yet
it was never so real to him, nor had he hungered
for the face of Betty Berry as now.... Jethro
stopped at his box, and he hurried down. There was a
letter from her&mdash;and one from Russia, too. The first
did not free his mind from sorrow&mdash;though the effort
was plain to do this very thing.... The letter from
Fallows filled the day:</p>

<p>“... I knew, John, if I sat down to write, it
would set free all my longing to go back to you. So I
have put it off from week to week.... From the
<i>Western States</i> I followed our old trail to Tokyo, then
via Peking, to Shanhaikwan, Koupangtse, Liaoyang....
I stopped there, and went around by the coal-fields,
where the millet had been planted all over again.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>I talked over the battle with the Japanese. They are
just as interested as ever in what the other man knows.
Though the big battle seemed like another life to me, it
was their immediate yesterday. They would do it all
over again. The Ploughman seemed to walk with me;
the rest was boyish babble.... I found Lowenkampf&mdash;white
and quiet&mdash;but the woman loves him, if
Russia does not. The little boy is a man-soul. That’s
the story&mdash;except that he sent his love to you. The
three are off to South America, and all is well....
Up in the Bosk hills, I followed the Summer. The old
man is gone. He had his sausages at the last....</p>

<p>“I was needed, but the little farm was all right. The
neighbor had done his part. There was enough for all....
How simple, one little vanity of a man such as
I am, and this family has enough and to spare; food and
firelight, good-will, their hope of heaven brought down
to comprehension again&mdash;all for so little, John. If men
only knew the joy of it&mdash;how it lasts and augments, how
it sustains the man who does it&mdash;to weave a mesh of
happiness for the poor. The fact is, he has to watch
very carefully, or he’ll get caught in the mesh himself.</p>

<p>“The little boy came running to meet me. I think
he ran to meet me somewhere before. He is different
from all the others&mdash;except for that touch of the old
mother which he has, and that something about the
Ploughman. He was white and all eyes when I picked
him up. They said he wasn’t well, but in three days he
was sound again&mdash;color breaking through. To think
that my coming could do that for any living soul&mdash;I.</p>

<p>“The old Mother.... She was just waiting for
me&mdash;lingering until I came&mdash;watching down the road in
the sunlight. We talked a little. She spoke softly of
her soldier-son. It was only a few days.... It all
came from her, John&mdash;the battle of Liaoyang so far as
its meaning to me. She was the light on the Ploughman’s
brow that made a different man of me. He never
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>dreamed of messages to the world of men, nor the passion
to serve men&mdash;but he had his mother’s faith and
something of her vision. That made him different from
other Russian soldiers, so that I could see. The little
boy Jan will bring it to life again. Your play goes
straight back to her. There’s everlasting quality in being
a mother like that. I think it was the fourth morning&mdash;that
I suddenly began to listen attentively to what she
was saying. It was about us all&mdash;intimately about her
soldier-son.... The younger mother came in&mdash;her
sad, weary face different.... She went out, and
returned with her shoes on.... Suddenly I knew
that the old sweet flower was passing. Why, she was
gone before I knew it&mdash;smiling up at the saints from
my arms.... I heard the little boy coming quickly&mdash;knew
his step as I would know yours, John. I seemed
to wait for his hand upon the door. I saw him, and he
saw us&mdash;came forward on tip-toe, and we were all together&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Morning didn’t read the rest just then. It seemed
one of the finest things he had ever known&mdash;Duke Fallows
preserving the old mother and the others in their
conviction that he was just a peasant like the Ploughman.</p>

<p class="ph2">4</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">F</span>rom</span> that April night after Morning left, when
Helen Quiston found her wandering in the halls,
and asking in a childish way to be taken to the ’cello
(saying that her father had hidden it from her in a
strange place), until now in mid-September, Betty Berry
had not left the studio-apartment. The real break-down
had begun a month before the high day in which Morning
came; perhaps on the very night his Guardian had
called. She had scarcely played or practiced since then;
she read nothing, talked to no one except Helen. Morning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
had noted her anxiously early on the day of his call
at the studio, but such power had come in the flashes of
those hours, and so high was she enthroned and illumined
in his own mind at the end, (in which she had kept to the
darkness), that he had not realized the blight that had
touched her life.</p>

<p>Helen Quiston had long loved the woman. She knew
much that the Doctor did not. It was she who read the
letters which in certain moments of the day Betty hastily
penned. It was as if for a moment in a long gray day, a
ray of watery sunlight broke through the cloud-banks.
In the momentary shining of her mind, Betty would
write to Morning. Many of the letters were impossible.
Certain of these letters would have brought the lover
by the first train. Even Betty had a sense of this and
relied upon the music-teacher. Here and there among
the notes, too, was a wisp of the old sweet spirit. It
was a wonderful conception to Helen Quiston: that all
but these had gone to replenish the creative fire of a
lover who knew well what his lady had given, but not
what it meant to her. Just as surely as the Hindoo
woman offers herself upon the funeral pyre with the body
of her mate, Betty Berry had given her spirit to the living.
A hundred times the singing teacher had heard
these words from white lips that smiled:</p>

<p>“<i>We are one&mdash;a deathless, world-loving one!</i>”</p>

<p>And often she heard this queer verse from the Persian:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“<i>Four eyes met. There were changes in two souls.</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>And now I cannot remember whether he is a man and I a woman,</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Or he a woman and I a man. All I know is,</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>There were two: Love came, and there is one....</i>”</div>
  </div></div></div>

<p>“Don’t forget to remind me that I must tell him I
am happy,” Betty would say.... When a letter
was finally finished and sealed, she would lean back, shutting
her eyes with a sigh, saying: “Now read me his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>that came to-day and yesterday.”... And afterward:
“Isn’t it wonderful, Helen, dear? Isn’t it quite
wonderful? You are so dear to understand.”</p>

<p>“Self-destruction is the first danger,” the Doctor had
said in the early days. “That’s why she should be in a
sanatorium under professional vigilance. Each case is
individual. She might take a sudden dislike to the saintliest
of nurses&mdash;even to you. The fever will not last, but
it is a long battle. Shock, overwork, a terrible disappointment&mdash;such
are the causes. Singular sweetness of
disposition, as in this case, is very rare. The thing that
goes with this usually is ‘the frozen stare’&mdash;hours motionless,
looking at the wall&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Morning’s letters were like white-hot fragments from
his forge&mdash;roughly fashioned, but still seething with
force. Helen Quiston felt that there was a splendid
singing in that forge; that a man’s voice attuned with
God and the world was raised in the morning; that
silence drew on as the concentration of the task deepened;
that there was singing in the evening again. Aliment
for the soul of the music teacher, these letters. She
would have fought to obey Betty Berry against the will
of the Doctor and nurse had it been necessary.</p>

<p>One of these September-morning letters was particularly
joyous with enthusiasm for Betty Berry’s gift
to him. He told again how it wove into, beautified and
energized his work.</p>

<p>“Literally I thank the stars for you,” Helen Quiston
read. “Sometimes it comes to me&mdash;as if straight from
you&mdash;strength that I feel with my limbs, strength that
means health. It surges through my veins like magic&mdash;so
that my eyes smart with tears. I speak your name
again and again in thankfulness for love fresh every day,
and for the pity for men in my heart&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Betty was not following. It was frequently so in the
first reading.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span></p>

<p>“Free,” she repeated softly, from a thought of yesterday’s
letter. “He said I was free. He said I never
explained&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear, he was writing of that night he came to
the theatre. I’ll get the letter for you to-night. He
said that you belonged to the risen world, the woman’s
world&mdash;that you trusted your vision&mdash;did not seek to
explain, but rejoiced. He said you had no guile, that
you asked nothing, and were unafraid. He means to
give the world a portrait of the risen woman&mdash;a portrait
of you.”</p>

<p>Betty Berry did not answer. Mention of that
night at the theatre invariably affected her to silence.</p>

<p>“I must hurry away for a little while, but I will finish
this,” Helen added, reading on:</p>

<p>“In the evenings, the greater power of you comes
over my life like a spiritual rain. I remember the art of
your hands, the sweet mystery of your lips; the tenderness
of your eyes and words; but over it all&mdash;the inner
power of you, strong as truth, pure as truth, wise as the
East, and sweet as the South. It is the spirit of you
that has come to me&mdash;your singing, winging, feminine
spirit. It has made me whole.... Do you know,
I used to think the world would be made better by force,
by arraignment, by revelation of evil. You have shown
me the better way of making the world better by loving
it. That’s woman’s way, the Christ’s way.... And
when I think that you have given me this blessed thing,
this finest fruit of earth&mdash;your love, created out of trial
and loneliness, your love, so pure and true and valorous&mdash;when
I think that it is mine, and how you fought
through the long day to give me this, <i>and only this</i>&mdash;when
I think of the splendor of that day’s work of yours,
I kneel to you, and to the spirit of the world&mdash;in the
wood, in the hut, before the door, under my elms, under
the stars,&mdash;I kneel to you and the Source of you. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>peace that comes, and the power&mdash;this, is my passionate
wish for you! I would restore it to you magnified.”</p>

<p>Helen Quiston read all this a second time that September
morning, although her pupils were waiting....
It was to her like the song from a strong man’s
house.</p>

<p>“You are rich and elect, Betty!” she cried. “You
have been a woman and <i>wanted</i> love. You have finished
your work at night, alone, and realized that there was
no one&mdash;your arms tired, your throat tired, your brain
and soul tired and heart-lonely&mdash;and there was no one.
How rich you are now! I think a woman is rich who can
say: ‘In London or Tokyo or New South Wales there is
one who loves me&mdash;who may be thinking at this moment
about me&mdash;who wishes I were there, or he were here;
whose heart’s warmth stretches across the distance and
makes the world a home, because he is in the world....
It would seem to me that I should be exultant
to-day&mdash;if there was such a one for me. It seems&mdash;if
I could see him in a year, even if I could not see him at
all, <i>and he were somewhere</i>&mdash;I should be all new and
radiant, born again.... But you, Betty dear&mdash;oh,
think what you have&mdash;what you are giving!”</p>

<p>Betty’s eyes were shut. There was a gray line around
the faint color of the lips, and she was pale as a candle-flame
in the morning sun.</p>

<p>“I wish you could stay with me, dearest,” she whispered.
“It is too much for me&mdash;when I am alone. But
when you are here, what you say and what you see&mdash;makes
me believe.... And you must tell me what
to write in answer to this&mdash;to satisfy him. I shall hold
it in my hand, and rest&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I’ll come back this afternoon. We’ll have supper,
and the letter will be mailed. You’ll know what to say
then&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>She hurried away, lest her heart break. The tired,
emotionless voice trailed after her. And all day she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>heard Betty’s voice among the unfinished voices, and saw
the spiritless clay of her heart’s friend sitting in deathly
labor below, tormented by the phantom of a will&mdash;like a
once glorious empire become desolate, a foolish scion
upon the throne.</p>

<p class="ph2">5</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">H</span>elen Quiston</span> was the brain of the studio, the
eyes and fingers&mdash;even, in part, the spirit of the
place that John Morning loved. It was a letter of hers
that John Morning answered with this paragraph:</p>

<p>“I shut my eyes after the first reading&mdash;and it seemed
to me I went sailing. There were many voyagers and
many islands&mdash;but I found <i>my Island</i>. It called to me
and I knew it was for me. The voyagers sailed on past
the curving inlets and the arrowed points&mdash;but I sailed
home. I found the fountains, the crags, the echoes, the
virgin springs, the mysterious meeting places of the land
and sea, the enchanted forest where the fairies are&mdash;and
the sun was rising. It was thus I answered the calling
mystery of your spirit....”</p>

<p>She was glad that his mind turned to the actual memory
picture of Betty Berry, as he finished:</p>

<p>“I do love the woman that moves about the world,
the woman others see&mdash;the lips that tremble, the eyes
that fill with tears so swiftly over some loveliness, and
so rarely over her own sorrow; the instant-enfolding
mind, the listening and the vitality&mdash;but it seems that I
love in a greater way the heart that called to its lover
without words&mdash;who fared forth to meet her lover and
gave her soul.”</p>

<p>More and more Helen Quiston perceived that John
Morning was becoming sufficient unto himself&mdash;the
larger lover, loving the world through his lady, and needing
less, even in thought, her hands and kisses and emotions.
She saw steadily that which Duke Fallows had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>made Betty Berry see for a night. She did not see it
as clearly as Betty Berry saw it that night, but she beheld
an enduring radiance from it, because her body was
not in the wreck of sacrifice. She had a woman’s sense
of the large relation of things, and a woman’s faith.
The misery of life as she had met it, the disorder, monotony,
and gray sorrow of it all, was her profound assurance
of another and brilliant side to the shield. She
wanted nothing for herself in these particular instances.
For Betty Berry she saw a swift transfer to a certain
indefinite perfection, no less attractive because it was
unlimned in her mind. Her own happiness, her great
privilege, was to be third in this miracle of a man and
woman passing beyond in a truly royal way. There was
a mystic quality that suited her mind in the coming of
the Guardian to Betty Berry’s room, and in the fact that
John Morning would never know of this. It was like
the coming of some Michael or Gabriel. From what she
knew of John Morning’s work, she could believe in the
planetary promise that the Guardian seemed to see; indeed,
she could have believed in it with less evidence,
because the Guardian said so.... Her particular
dream was for the man to appear who would make
women see what it was in their hands and hearts to do
for the coming race. She dreamed of a man to come
with words to women that would be reflected upon the
brows of children to be, that would help to fashion the
latent dreams into great children. She believed it was
the agony of being childless that put this dream into her
own mind, and she believed that the world-ignition could
only come from a man who knew the same agony....
So she listened raptly to the singing from the
forge; and more and more, with almost unspeakable excitement,
she realized that the voice of John Morning
was slowly and surely taking to itself the authority and
harmony which his Guardian had promised.</p>

<p>He wrote often now of the rehearsals of <i>Compassion</i>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>of his large fears and small satisfactions in them. He
was always glad to get back to the cabin and the Book....
That book&mdash;some of her own inner life would
be in it. She had given in the letters everything she
dared. Her tears were all shed; there was dry burning
in her eyes, for what Betty Berry had given to that Book....
Now in mid-September it was done, all but a
month’s chiseling and polishing. It would be given to
the publisher two weeks before the first appearance of
<i>Compassion</i> at the <i>Markheim</i> the first week in November....
She dared not think what would happen
when the Book was done, and the destiny of the play
established.... A letter from Morning at this time
contained for Helen Quiston one winged, triumphant
sentence. She was reading aloud to Betty Berry:</p>

<p>“It was straight, clean going, right to the end of the
book.... It is hard-held. It is kind. It laughs.
It goes after the deepest-down man.... You have
to reach almost self-effacement to associate with fine
ideas and to get to the front in service.... How
hard it was to make me see that the real world is not
over there among writers and publishers and drama-producers,
but everywhere among the hearts of the poor!</p>

<p>“And, oh, Betty Berry, it isn’t the book&mdash;it’s the life
that counts. You have made me live. You earned your
strength alone&mdash;suffering alone through the years.
That’s the highest honor that can come to man or woman
in this world&mdash;to be chosen for such years as you have
known. It comes only to the strong&mdash;the strength to
stand alone. The world bows sooner or later before
such character. Men feel it, though their eyes be shut.</p>

<p>“There is a certain excellence in the honor of standing
alone. Alone, man or woman is either ahead or behind
the crowd. In the latter case, he is imbecile or defective,
and God is with him.... God is in the
forward solitudes, too. What a splendor about standing
in the full light! The crowd cannot get it. The crowd
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>keeps the light from itself. There the maiming is, the
suffering, the cruelty; there the light is divided, and the
warmth is the low heat of men, not the grand primal
vitality of the Sun. There in the crowd, Apparition and
Appearance take the place of the Real.... Now
and then, in the torturing passage of the crowd, the landmark
of some pioneer is reached, and the cry goes up,
‘We are on the right road, for that man passed here!’
The name of the pioneer becomes part of the crowd’s
impedimenta. Perhaps he smiles from the Other Side,
not because the crowd has found <i>his</i> trail&mdash;he may have
wanted that once, though not long&mdash;but looking back
upon his greater birth, he smiles&mdash;the place where he
emerged and stood alone on the grand frontier....
You have made me strong enough to believe that you
and I may go away up into the coolness beyond the
senses&mdash;even in this life&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Helen Quiston stopped. That last was the final sanction.
The Guardian knew, when he chose John Morning.
It was the one thought she had hardly dared formulate
for him, and which she had awaited ardently during the
late weeks.</p>

<p>“He means that a woman can go, too!” she cried,
trembling, forgetful even of Betty Berry; “he is on the
path&mdash;higher, higher&mdash;and yet, he says that women, too,
can go that way alone&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Betty Berry frowned. “What does he mean by going
alone&mdash;about a man and a woman going alone?” She
was suffering to understand, angry that the other understood.</p>

<p>“He says that the woman may also go alone to that
Eminence! No man&mdash;no human man&mdash;has ever said that
before. Men think of <i>men passing</i> upward. People
caught in their desires have forever lied to themselves,
trying to believe that man and woman can go <i>together</i>....
He says here&mdash;&mdash;” her eye darted on to read:</p>

<p>“‘Men and women gain their strength to reach that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>Eminence by being alone&mdash;by loving alone!’ You taught
him that.... Don’t you see, dearest, it is the beginning
of his real message? You gave it to him&mdash;and
what a message it is for you and for&mdash;even for me&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But woman is the serpent,” Betty Berry muttered.</p>

<p>Helen arose to turn on a wall light. Her hand fumbled.
Her eyes could not be brought down from that
lofty plateau. A strange peace had come into the loneliness
of her life. She wanted to tell it everywhere&mdash;to
Nuns of the World.... It had been a man’s world
so long&mdash;that this thought had never come. Always in
the world’s thought and art&mdash;the flesh of woman had
kept her down in the dusks and valleys. Sons climbed;
lovers left their maids to climb ... but only the
Gods knew all the time <i>that daughters could go</i>.</p>

<p>Betty was silent. It had become the habit of her life
not to speak when the mists thickened.... The
picture of Dante and Beatrice was in the light. Helen
pointed to it:</p>

<p>“Who would think of saying that Beatrice, who was
the Way&mdash;did not share the vision and the consciousness?”
she asked softly.</p>

<p>Betty shut her eyes. The other returned with eager
love and sat down at her knees. “And now I will read
the last. Just think how clearly he sees:</p>

<p>“‘The world is so dear to me because of you. I am
so freshly conscious of its roundness, of the profile of its
coasts as seen from above; of its light and darkness, the
sharpness of sun in the retreating gray, of its skies and
its peaks, the last to darken and the first to answer the
morn.... I put the candle away just now, and in
the darkness I saw the Earth from above&mdash;not from
afar, but from some space nearer than the moon. I saw
it all at once. The moon shining upon one side, the sun
shining upon the other&mdash;a golden side, a silver side....
And I saw you afterward&mdash;not as you are in the
studio, but as a shadowed, quiet figure among moonlit
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>ruins. You were calm, and moved silently here and there.
Ruins were about you, yet you seemed to know the things
to do.’ What does it mean?”</p>

<p>“What does it mean, Helen?” Betty repeated.</p>

<p>The other’s eyes filled with tears. The question
might have come from a little old lady of eighty, whose
house of life was locked, all but the sitting-room.</p>

<p>“It’s just a dream, dear,” she whispered.</p>

<p>“There are no ruins about me&mdash;when you are here,”
Betty said.</p>

<p>“Ruins, dearest?... No, gardens and living
temples&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Betty arose, and moved slowly up and down the studio,
then stood by her chair. The impulse even to lift
her hand was unusual. She moved now with difficulty,
but was not conscious of it. The room was dark, except
for the one wall-light. Helen went to her side, helped
her at last to the chair. Betty’s face was deathly, but
there was a mournful reasonableness in her eyes, a faint
grasp of actuality, that the other had not seen for weeks.
The old enemies, memory and hope, were in feeble
conflict.</p>

<p>“Do you think he means that I am not well?”</p>

<p>“He was only expressing a dream-picture....
I’m sure he hasn’t interpreted it&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But he will. That comes afterward&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Betty was either better or worse.... The Doctor
came. As he was leaving, Helen walked to the stairs
with him.</p>

<p>“Yes, there is a change,” he said.</p>

<p>“You think it is good?”</p>

<p>“Yes.... It’s been nearly six months. Yes, I
think it is good. She would have been dead without you,
Miss Quiston. I don’t know what you do&mdash;but you keep
her from the engrossing mania.”</p>

<p>“She has some strength, Doctor?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span></p>
<p>“It is all a matter of will at this stage. All along we
have battled to keep her somehow nourished.”</p>

<p>Helen went back to the studio. Betty was on her
feet again. The nurse was at hand, but she had never
been able to involve herself in the patient’s understanding.
She left the room now, anticipating the inevitable
request.</p>

<p>“Do you think, Helen&mdash;that as he finishes his work&mdash;more
and more&mdash;the ruins will come back to mind?”</p>

<p class="ph2">6</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> Summer was done; the book had been ten days
out of Morning’s hand; the final rehearsals were
engrossing and painful, and the letters from the hill-cabin,
though buoyant, were not so frequent....
Service for men&mdash;service for men! The words seemed
integrated into the life of the man. There was something
herculean in his striving. The long Summer had
ripened the harvest. Conceptions which had been vague
and dreamy in the first letters were ready at his hand
now, daily expressions of his work. Helen Quiston, so
long dream-fed, trembled at the thought that she had
something to do with a giant’s making.</p>

<p>It never occurred to her that the things so real in
her mind were at least an age distant from the interests
of the world. She did not stop to think that the drama so
vital and amazing to her would be out of the comprehension
even of the decent doctor who came to the studio
day after day. Not once did it enter her mind that the
world would regard her as heartless and fanatic for her
strength in so ruthlessly holding her closest friend to
the sacrifice. Her problem now was what to do with
John Morning after the first night of the play, and the
report upon his book was in. She was afraid he would
come. He would see Betty Berry&mdash;see what her giving
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>had done. He would learn that it was she, Helen Quiston,
who had given him the peace in which to find the
larger consciousness; her letters, in Betty Berry’s hand,
that had filled the distances with peace for him.</p>

<p>She had no thought for John Morning except as an
instrument. It was something the way Duke Fallows
had thought of him at the last. Either one would have
sacrificed themselves, but they were not called. Only
Betty Berry loved him for himself, and to her was the
altar. They loved him for the future, and guarded him
as the worker-bees guard the queen because she is potentially
the coming race.</p>

<p>And this was the miracle: John Morning at his work
had passed the need of the kiss of woman. He had been
tided over the grand crossing by the love of Betty Berry.
Receiving it now, he did not hold it for himself, but
gave it forth in service to men.... There was
something cosmic about this to Helen Quiston.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Breathless expectancy in the studio on the early November
evening of <i>Compassion’s</i> first performance at
the <i>Markheim</i>. Though nothing of the sort had been
arranged, Helen Quiston expected a telegram after the
Play. It was not yet cold, but an east wind had been
rising since dark, and there was tension in the sounds
and shaking everywhere. Betty had, for her, a very
keen sense of the importance of the night to the man in
New York.</p>

<p>“I feel as if I had lived, Betty,” her friend whispered.
“Oh, what must it be to you?”</p>

<p>“I feel that I have died,” the other murmured.</p>

<p>Though she rested better and accepted food with less
reluctance, (the doctor declaring himself satisfied with
the progress of the past six weeks), it had been the hardest
period for Helen Quiston. Something was in Betty’s
mind that was not confided. Often in the evening she
showed a preference for being alone. Helen feared for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>a time that the other might write a letter without her
supervision, but as there was no change in the tenor of
Morning’s replies, the outpouring of his thankfulness in
no way diminished, the only conclusion was that Betty
at least had not mailed such a one. She had taken sudden
dislikes to several different nurses in turn. When she
wanted anything there was a terrible concentration about
it. Helen and the doctor and all concerned were drawn
into the vortex.</p>

<p>“It’s the way she used to practice,” her friend said.</p>

<p>“Miss Quiston&mdash;&mdash;” began the doctor.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it doesn’t matter. I was just thinking&mdash;are you
so real to all your friends?”</p>

<p>“I have no friend like Betty.”</p>

<p>“That eases my mind.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“A few friends like that and there wouldn’t be any
singing teacher.”</p>

<p>Helen Quiston realized fully for the first time that
the doctor was exactly a human being, having the various
features of the species.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>They were startled by a crash in the inner room. The
nurse entered quickly to announce that a flower-pot containing
a fuchsia had fallen from the window-sill.</p>

<p>“The plant is in ruins,” she said.</p>

<p>Betty rose immediately. <i>Ruins</i>&mdash;the word was a fiery
stimulant to her. In a few moments she ceased her pacing,
saying that she was utterly weary. Helen, though
leaving for the room she occupied, a flight above, could
but remark upon the gleaming intensity of Betty’s eyes,
and the restless leaping of her hands....</p>

<p>The nurse came to her. Betty went with her into
the inner room. In the next fifteen minutes, the patient
was more or less alone, while the studio couch, upon
which the nurse was accustomed to rest, was being prepared.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
Unwatched, her movements quickened, a queer,
furtive smile played upon her lips, and certain actions
altogether uncommon occupied her concentrated attention.
The key was quietly removed from the door between
the studio and the living-room; a large bundle
was carried from a closet-shelf to the rear window and
tossed out. From behind the books in a small case near
the reading-lamp a purse was produced; and finally, when
the nurse was at the farthest end of the studio, Betty
drew a large, sharp knife from the same hiding-place,
and with astonishing quiet and force severed the telephone
wires just beneath the bell-box, fastened to the
wall close to the floor. The knife was returned to its
hiding-place. The nurse joined her, and Betty, at the
studio door, suddenly sank into a chair with a cry of
exhaustion. The other ran to her.</p>

<p>“It is nothing! Bring some water&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The nurse had not reached the medicine-case in the
bath, when the patient sprang up and locked the intervening
door of the apartment, leaving the woman inside
with a “dead” telephone.</p>

<p>For the first time in half a year, Betty left the studio,
carefully closing the main door. Out the back way, she
found her parcel, and in the windy darkness put on the
rain-coat, traveling hat, veil, gloves and shoes it had
contained, departing breathlessly through the alley gate.</p>

<p>For a long time the hammering upon floors and walls
could not be located in the studio-building. The outer
floor of Betty’s apartment was tried, but found locked;
and since there was no response to the bell, nothing came
of the offerings of the earlier Samaritans. Much time
was occupied by the nurse in trying to call the telephone-exchange.
A stranger in the street was finally persuaded,
from the upper window, to find the janitor of
the building and send him to the Quiston studio. Master
keys set the nurse free.</p>

<p>Helen Quiston first notified the Doctor, who came
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>hastily. The story of the nurse was explicit as a hospital
report.</p>

<p>“Is your car here, Doctor?” Miss Quiston asked presently.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Will you take me down-town? I’ll be ready in a
moment.”</p>

<p>“Gladly.”</p>

<p>The Doctor was informed in a tense but controlled
voice that the patient was doubtless at this moment upon
a certain east-bound train. “Betty left here a few minutes
after nine,” Helen added. “The train I’m thinking
of left at ten-five. It is now eleven.... Oh, I
wonder what she had on? She was dressed when I left
her&mdash;shirt-waist, black skirt, house-slippers&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Five minutes’ search and thinking on the part of Miss
Quiston uncovered the fact that Betty’s rain-coat and a
certain small traveling hat were missing.... Nothing
was positively established at the station.</p>

<p>“I must send a telegram, Doctor,” Helen said.</p>

<p>It was to Morning at his rural-delivery address. Her
heart sank with fear lest the message fail to reach him,
until it was finally handled by the post-office.</p>

<p>“There’s nothing further to do,” she said hopelessly.</p>

<p>Night brought no news, nor the early morning. At
nine-thirty o’clock, Helen Quiston was leaving the studio
for the morning’s work, when she heard a light, swift
step on the stairs&mdash;someone coming up at least three steps
at a time. The hall-door was half-swung. Helen stood
waiting.... Now a stranger was at the doorway,
hesitating, yet expectant. His brow was tanned, as if
he had walked bare-headed in the sun. His gray eyes
were remarkably clear and very kind. For a second or
two they stood face to face, forgetting to speak.</p>

<p>“Where is Betty Berry?” It was a demand, yet
gently spoken.</p>

<p>“Are you&mdash;are you John Morning?”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>“Yes.... Where is she?”</p>

<p>“I think she has gone to you&mdash;I do not know, but I
think she has gone to the hill-cabin&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Are you her friend?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;I am Miss Quiston.”</p>

<p>“When did she go?”</p>

<p>“Last night. I telegraphed you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He came close to her. His hand upon her shoulder
drew her to a chair, and he brought another near. “I
will not stop to ask questions,” he said heavily. “You
tell me all&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What of the play?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know&mdash;I left before it was done to come
here.... She is ill&mdash;go on&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The story faltered at first, but the gray eyes steadied
her. Toward the end she talked swiftly, coherently. She
winged over the one certain cause of Betty’s illness....
When she stopped, it seemed to her that some
mighty machinery was whirring below, its vibrations in
the floor and walls.</p>

<p>He arose, stood beside her&mdash;all the light and reason
gone from his face. For several seconds he stood there,
his left hand swiftly tapping her shoulder. The powers
of the man were afar&mdash;miles away upon his hill. This
was just a tapping blind man in the room....</p>

<p>“I must go. I have no words now.... She is
there. It must be nearly ten now. I must hurry to
her.”</p>

<p>The engines in the house flagged and were silent.</p>

<p>The woman stood where he had left her, smiling.</p>

<p class="ph2">7</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">B</span>etty</span> held her purse tightly in her hand, and certain
thoughts were held as tightly in her brain, as
she pressed against the wind.... It was something
like going to a distant concert engagement in the night....
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>Her limbs were uncertain, and there was a constant
winging in her breast, as though it were the cage
of a frantic bird. She did not mind. She could forget
it&mdash;if only her eyes remained true. For the first time in
months she was on her own strength, her own will.
There was a sharp distress in the responsibility, but also
an awakening of force.</p>

<p>The wind whipped her breath away, yet she liked the
wild freedom of it&mdash;if only she could continue to see and
remember what to say. The studio was a hideous blackness
that drove her from behind. This was a new and
consuming hatred. The two squares to the large uptown
hotel where a cab was readily obtainable were long
as a winter night; and the tension to remember seemed
destroying her by the time she found a driver. She told
him the station and the train.</p>

<p>“Plenty of time, Ma’am,” he said.</p>

<p>Her eyes filled with tears. It was true, then, that
there was such a station, such a train, that there was
time, and nothing had betrayed her. “I must not speak;
I must not speak,” kept warning in her mind; “but he is
so good to me!”</p>

<p>Now she felt the cold, as she rested a moment before
the new ordeal at the station&mdash;destination, tickets, the
Pullman, not to fall, not to speak any but the exact
words.... The driver helped her out. Everything
was familiar, but miraculously large.... She gave
the man extra money, and the faintest, humblest “Thank
you!” escaped her. He whistled a porter for her.</p>

<p>“The ticket window,” she said. And now she need
only follow. It was warmer. It would be warm in the
Pullman.... She took the young colored man’s
arm. He turned with good nature.</p>

<p>“I have been ill,” she said. It was frightened from
her lips.</p>

<p>“There is plenty of time, Miss. I’ll see you through
to the berth&mdash;the ten-five&mdash;yes’m.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span></p>

<p>The quick tears started again, and an aching lump in
her throat. She wanted to cry out her thankfulness.
She wanted to be told again and again&mdash;that all this was
not a dream, from which she would awaken in that place
of death. The value of her veil awed her; and it was
<i>she</i> who had thought of it. Could it really be true that
she had forgotten nothing? Would she actually arrive
at her journey’s end?</p>

<p>The porter procured berth and tickets, and now he
assured her that her train was ready. She followed him
through interminable distances, down countless stairs;
she watched and listened critically, as he delivered both
tickets to the Pullman conductor. All she had to do was
to follow, to say nothing and to pay. With what thankfulness
did she pay; and with what warming courtesy
were her gifts received. Surely the world was changed.
It had become so dear and good.... She had a
far-off vision of a peremptory Betty Berry of another
world, striding to and fro among men and trains and
cities, giving her commands, expecting obedience, conferring
gratuities according to rigid principle.</p>

<p>The car-porter was more wonderful than any&mdash;an
old Southern darkey, with little patches of gray beard,
absurdly distributed. A homing gentleness was in his
voice, and his smile was from a better world....
There had been another porter like him somewhere.</p>

<p>“She goes clear through,” the station porter said,
“and she’s been sick.”</p>

<p>“Ah’ll see the young Miss clar’ through,” the old
man drawled. “Just depen’ on me, Miss. Sit right down
here&mdash;berth’ll be ready right smaht.”</p>

<p>She did not sleep, but she was warm and not uncomfortable.
She dared think a little of the end of the journey,
but there was so much to do in the morning, so much
to keep in mind. She held fast to her purse. In her dependence,
the magic of it was like a strange discovery.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>In the early morning, the porter brought her coffee with
some hot milk and toast. The wind had long since been
left behind, but a cold rain was falling. She would be
cold. The terminal was reached. The old man bore her
forth. There was something merciful and restoring in
his gentle gratitude. A station porter led her to the
Hackensack car.</p>

<p>She thought of breakfast on the way, but forgot it
again upon reaching Hackensack, where she was directed
to the post-office.</p>

<p>She wrote the address of John Morning and asked
shiveringly at the stamp window if there was any way
in which she could be delivered there.</p>

<p>The clerk could not see if she were laughing under
the veil.</p>

<p>“The rural carrier knows the way,” she added. “I’d
be willing to pay well&mdash;”</p>

<p>The clerk craned his head back through the office,
and called:</p>

<p>“Jethro!”</p>

<p>A large, dusty man came forward with the air of
having just breakfasted. He took the slip containing
the address from her hand.</p>

<p>“The lady wants to go with you, Jethro&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The rural carrier tilted his spectacles benignly to regard
her.</p>

<p>“Bless me&mdash;ever been there?”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;but letters go safely&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I rather think they do&mdash;since I take ’em. Is this
your writing?”</p>

<p>The place was darkening, suffocating to her. “Yes
... if you would only take me. Five, ten
dollars&mdash;oh, I should be so glad to pay anything I
have&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The carrier penetrated the veil.</p>

<p>“Just sit down by the heater, Lady,” he said in a lowered
tone. “We’ll get there, and it won’t cost you five
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>or ten dollars, neither. I know where you want to go,
and I know who you are, if I’m not mistaken. Lizzie
and I will get you there&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>She turned quickly, for the tears were coming....
Could it really be that she had remembered
everything? Was she really going to him, and this the
last stage of the journey? The heart of the large, dusty
man had radiated so suddenly upon her. She was not
afraid of him, but she must not faint nor speak until she
was away from the others. Very still she sat by the
heater, praying for strength, praying that it was not all
a dream....</p>

<p>“Miss Betty Berry!”</p>

<p>There was an instant in which the call had but a vague
meaning; then shot home to her the hideous fear of being
taken back. She was close to screaming, yet it was
only the rural-carrier coming.</p>

<p>“Yes?” she said, clearing her throat.</p>

<p>“I thought I couldn’t be wrong,” he said. “I’ve
brought a good many letters addressed to you back to
town from the place you’re going, and carried a good
many out yonder in this writing of yours.... Lizzie
and me are ready, Miss.”</p>

<p>As they stepped out the rear door, he touched her arm
reflectively, and re-entered to bring a hairy black robe.
The vehicle, of a vanished type, was gray even in the
rain, and cocked to one side from the sagging of years,
where the carrier sat. Betty’s weight did not visibly
impress the high side. He tucked the hairy robe about
her, the mail-bags at her feet, picked up the lines, and
lo! they moved.</p>

<p>“Lizzie ain’t very showy on knee action, Miss Berry,”
he said, “but along about half-past eleven, when we get
there, you’ll remark she’s stiddy.”</p>

<p>It was only ten now.... Mud and miles and
mail-boxes; dragging moments, and miles and cold rain....
She had to talk a little. The journey of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>night was nearest, and she told how good the train-men
had been to her.</p>

<p>“You haven’t traveled much, Miss, I take it?” he said
softly.</p>

<p>“Oh, no.” Then distantly again she remembered a
Betty Berry of concert seasons&mdash;on the wing from city
to city. It was all too remote for speech. At one house
a woman came forth with tea and sandwiches. Betty
was grateful for the warm drink and wanted to pay, but
the carrier pushed back her hand and tucked her in
again.</p>

<p>“Guess this is going to be a surprise for the bare-headed
man?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“He’s your young man, then?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>He seemed relieved. “He won’t be staying out here
much longer&mdash;not likely&mdash;though we do have a spell of
good weather in November mostly.”</p>

<p>Often she lost every sense of distance and identity.
The lapses grew longer toward the end, and when she
did not answer, Jethro thought she had fallen asleep....
A long stretch at last, barren of mail-boxes....
When he finally drew up, she followed his eyes
to her lover’s name upon the tin by the roadside. Then
he pointed beyond the low near trees and hollows. It
was all desolate; the Fall tints subdued in the pervading
gray. She saw a clump of greater trees in the upper
middle distance.</p>

<p>“’Bout a thousand feet straight in. Miss&mdash;and up&mdash;under
them big trees. You’ll see his shanty before
you’re half-way. Just keep your eye on them elms.
He’d be down here if it was any kind of weather. Guess
you’re glad. D’ruther go alone and find him there,
wouldn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes.... And now I want to give you this,
please.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span></p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>She could not leave him so. “For Lizzie&mdash;she’s so
steady. I’m rich ... and I’ll be much happier&mdash;going
to the bare-headed man. Please&mdash;for me&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Don’t you take that robe off!” he said suddenly. “I
don’t want it&mdash;jumpin’ in and out. I never take it out
of the office till snow flies. He’ll bring it down to the
box, when I’m passin’ to-morrow. Why, you’d get all
soaked, Miss&mdash;a-goin’ up to him.... Well, I’ll
take the money for Lizzie&mdash;if you’re rich&mdash;but it’s ridiculous
much, and I’d have fetched you for nothin’.”</p>

<p>She pressed his hand in both of hers and turned away
through the break in the fence.... It seemed
darker; and when the grinding of the tires on the wet
gravel died away, the dripping silence came home to her,
alien and fearful.... She had seen the name; soon
she would see his house&mdash;but this was no man’s land, an
after-death land; this was ‘the hollows and the vagueness
of light,’ of which he had written....</p>

<p>She saw the house and faltered on. She had not the
strength to call.... On the slope to the great trees
the burden of the heavy robe would have borne her to
the ground, had she not let it fall from her.... She
could not believe the padlock on the door, felt it with her
hands, the weight and the brass of it. It was hard for
her to understand the cruel cold of it&mdash;as for a child
that has never been hurt intentionally. She sank to her
knees and prayed that it was not there.... But it
was. The reality entered her brain, the thick icy metal
of it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“Betty Berry&mdash;Betty Berry, I am coming!”</p>

<p>She lifted her head in the rain. His call was like a
thought of her own, but sharper, truer. This was his
door. He was coming. It was still light. She wanted
to sleep again, but the death-like cold warned her. She
would die before he came....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span></p>

<p>She raised herself against the door. The black heap
of the fur-robe on the slope held her eyes.... On
the way to it she fainted again; again the cold rain roused
her.... Always on the borders of the rousing, she
heard it:</p>

<p>“Betty Berry&mdash;Betty Berry, I am coming!”</p>

<p>She knelt in the wet leaves beside the robe ...
her thoughts turned back to the night&mdash;the goodness of
the men, their tender voices.... There was a calling
up in the dusk among the trees. Yes, she must lie
at his door. Men were good; the lock alone had hurt
her. His Guardian had put it there.... Upward
she crawled, dragging the robe.</p>

<p>“Yes, you are coming!” she answered. Always when
the cold rain roused her, she would answer, and crawl a
little farther with the robe. At the door at last, she lay
down beneath it....</p>

<p>Still again his calling roused her. It was darker&mdash;but
not yet night....</p>

<p>“Betty Berry&mdash;Betty Berry, I am coming!”</p>

<p>It was nearer.</p>

<p>“I knew you would let me in,” she tried to say, and
then&mdash;voices.... It seemed as if the porter of the
Old South had come.... His voice lulled her, and
his smile was the glow of the home-hearth.</p>

<p class="ph2">8</p>

<p><span class="smcap">She</span> was lying upon the single narrow bed....
Something long ago had been premonitive of this.
Morning’s mind, too, caught up the remembrance of
Moto-san and the Japanese Inn.... He watched.
Sometimes he said with all his will that she must not die.
She could not die, when his will was dominant, but he
was exhausted; his will-power flagged frequently.</p>

<p>All day yesterday in the train he had held her in his
mind&mdash;sent his calls to her across the miles. From different<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
stations he had telegraphed to Jake at Hackensack,
to Jethro at the post-office, and to his neighbor,
the dairyman, who had a telephone. Jethro had been
the first to reach the cabin, but it was nearly dusk then.
The others were quick to appear. Jethro found her at
the door, partly covered in the furry robe. That robe
crowned him in Morning’s mind. They had broken in
the door, and lit the fire. Morning reached the cabin at
nine. Jethro spoke of a doctor.</p>

<p>“I’m the doctor,” Morning said. The three had left
him.</p>

<p>It was now after midnight. She had not aroused.
Old scenes quivered across the surface of her consciousness,
starting a faintly mumbled sentence now and then:
The Armory, the first kiss, the road to Baltimore, letters,
hurried journeys, the Guardian; and much about the
latest journey&mdash;from cab to station, from porter to Pullman,
from car to clerk to carrier. He saw how the night
and the day had used her final strength. Always the
Guardian intervened to break her will, and Morning did
not understand. There were other enemies; the studio,
the nurse, the padlock, and the rain. After brief hushes,
she would speak of his coming, or answer his calling.</p>

<p>It was the one theme of his life even now&mdash;the great
thing Betty Berry had done. It awed and chilled him
to realize how coarse-fibered he had been, so utterly impervious,
not to sense the nature of the force that had
upheld him, nor the quality of the bestowals....
There was a rending about it, and yet it was all so quiet
now. It seemed to him that a man’s life is husk after
husk of illusion, that the illusions are endless. He had
torn them away, one after another, thinking each time
that he had come to the grain.... And what was
the sum of his finding so far? That good is eternal; that
man loves God best by serving men; that greatness is
in the working, not in the result; that a man who has
found his work has found the soul’s sunlight, and that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>service for men is its rain. Surely, these are not husks....
It had been a hard, weary way. He was like
a tired child now, and here was the little mother&mdash;wearied
with him unto death.... He had been so
perverse and headstrong. She had given him her love
and guidance until her last strength was spent. He must
be the man now.... He wondered if his heart
would break, when he realized fully his own evil and her
unfathomable sweetness?... Must a woman always
fall spent and near to death&mdash;before a man can be
finished? Or is it because her work is done that she falls?</p>

<p>He knelt beside her. Sometimes, in the lamplight, she
looked as he had seen her at the Armory; again, as if
she were playing; now, it was as she had been to him
in the dark of the Pullman seat.... Who was the
Guardian?</p>

<p>... And this was what had come to her from
teaching him the miracle of listening alone.... It
was true. He belonged to that life, as Duke Fallows
had always said. She had made him see it by going
from him. He would never be the same, after having
tasted the greater love, in which man and woman are
one in the spirit of service, having renounced the emblem
of it. And with all her vision and leading&mdash;the glory
of it had not come to her as to him. It had all but killed
her. She had come to him&mdash;a forgotten purpose, a
broken vessel.</p>

<p>He would love her back to life. That was his work
now. Everything must stop for that&mdash;even truth....
He halted. If he loved her back to full and
perfect health again, would she not be the same as she
had been? Would she not take up her Cross again?...
No, he would not let her. He would destroy
the results of his work if necessary. He would force
himself to forget, even in the spirit&mdash;this taste of the
mystic oneness that had come to him. He would show
his need for her every hour. That would make her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>happy&mdash;his leaning upon her word and thought and
action. He would show her his need of her presence in
the long, excellent forenoons, in the very processes of
his task&mdash;and in the evenings, her hands, her kisses, her
step, her voice; he would make her see that these were
his perfect essentials.</p>

<p>“I’ve talked and written a lot about how a man should
live&mdash;in the past six months,” he said grimly. “I’ve got
to do a bit of real living in the world now. God knows
I love her&mdash;as I used to. That seemed enough then!”</p>

<p>He looked up from her face. The ghost of day had
come softly to the South. He arose, took the lamp
across the room and blew it out. Then he opened the
door. The mingled night and dawn came in, a cool dimness,
but the rain had ceased. He replenished the fire,
left the door open, and returned to her. She had become
quiet since the lamp had been taken away....
A sense of the man and woman together, and of her
strength returning crept upon him. He welcomed it,
though the deeps cried out.</p>

<p>“When you are yourself, you will want to go away
again&mdash;the long, blinding ways of the sun,” he whispered.
“But I will say, ‘I cannot spare you, Betty Berry.
This is the place for two to be. We will begin
again&mdash;&mdash;’”</p>

<p>His thought of what she would answer brought back
to mind the play, <i>Compassion</i>, and the Book of John
Morning.... He smiled. He had almost forgotten.
Night before last, at the beginning of the third act,
he had left the <i>Markheim</i>. He had given way suddenly
to the thought that had pulled at him all day&mdash;to take the
train to Betty Berry that night.... The play had
seemed good. Even to him there had been moments of
thrilling joy. It had been surprisingly different, sitting
in front with the audience, from the rehearsals. Of yesterday’s
notices he had not seen a single one. It was a
far thought to him even now of the play’s failure, but if
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>it did fail, how easy to say to Betty Berry, “You see, how
mad I was alone&mdash;how mad in my exaltation&mdash;how terribly
out of tune? I needed you here. I need you
now&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Then he thought of the bigger thing&mdash;the Book.
There wasn’t a chance for that to fail. It would find its
own. What would he say about that?... He
would say, “I love you, Betty Berry. It was loving you
that made the book. And when it was done&mdash;how I
longed for you!”</p>

<p>That was true&mdash;true now.... He kissed her
shut eyelids. There was blessedness in her being here&mdash;even
shattered and so close to death&mdash;blessedness and a
dreadful fear. That fear was ever winging around, but
did not come home to him and fold its wings. He was
not himself.... “My God!” he cried out, “what
folds upon folds and phases upon phases of experience
a man must pass to learn to live&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>For an instant it all came back&mdash;that taste of the open
road and larger dimension of man&mdash;the listening, the
labor, the sharpened senses, scant diet, tireless service,
‘the great companions’&mdash;love of the world and unfailing
compassion.... It was as they had said. He had
belonged everywhere but in a woman’s arms....</p>

<p>It came clear as a vision, and he put it from him as
an evil thing&mdash;and all the voices. The red dawn was
staring into his eyes, and afar off a horse nickered. He
held his hands against the light, as if to destroy it.</p>

<p>“I have said it in the Book, ‘We have all eternity to
play in,’ and if that is not a lie&mdash;this Call will come to
me again!”</p>

<p>And this was his renunciation.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Her stillness troubled him.</p>

<p>“I am your lover,” he whispered. “I will not let you
go, Betty Berry. Don’t you hear&mdash;I love you?”</p>

<p>He lifted her, walked to and fro between the fire and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>the cot. She was so very little.... The day came
up with a mystic shining, and the warmth returned.
These were the first hours of that fleeting Indian summer,
the year’s illumination&mdash;the serene and conscious
death of Summer.... The door was wide open to
the light.... Morning put down his burden, but
could not be still. He brought water and scrubbed the
floor and door-step. The wood shone white as it dried&mdash;white
as the square table which was an attraction of
daylight. He tossed the water away down the hollow,
drew more and washed as the countrymen do, lifting
handfuls to his head. Then he brought basin, soap, and
towels&mdash;bathed her face and hands, afterward carrying
her forth to the sunlight. The thin shade of the elms
was far down the meadow, for the day was not high.</p>

<p>“I love you, Betty Berry,” he continued to repeat, as
he turned again and again to the cot. There was an
hypnotic effect in the words; and there was a certain
numbed surface in his brain that refused to cope with
the immediate stresses in the room.</p>

<p>Jethro came early, and was not content to leave the
mail at the box. He brought letters, a paper, and a large
package. Jethro looked at the face on the cot and at the
bare-headed man. Words failed him to whom words
were so easy. He ventured to mention the name of a
doctor, and was answered furiously:</p>

<p>“I am the doctor.”</p>

<p>Jethro lingered. Morning turned suddenly to look at
the cot, and it seemed to the carrier that his eyes would
have frightened away death.... Morning caught
him by the shoulders:</p>

<p>“You’re a good man, Jethro,” he said hastily.
“When I think of that fur robe&mdash;it seems as if I’ve got
to do something for you with my hands.”</p>

<p>The carrier went his way.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This he found in the newspaper&mdash;a “follow” paragraph<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>
apparently to the dramatic notice of the day before:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The second performance of <i>Compassion</i> last
night to a fairly filled house is interesting in its relation
to the fear frankly expressed in this column yesterday,
to the effect that <i>Compassion</i> is too good a
play to get on well. The fear was well founded upon
experience; and yet we may have before us an exception&mdash;a
quality of excellence that will not be subdued.
It is too much to hope for, that at any other
time this season we will be equally glad to find our
fear for a play’s future ill-founded.”</p>
</div>

<p>Morning had not known of the doubt; and this was
the rise of the tide again from the doubt.... He
glanced at the package. There was a spreading cold in
his vitals. It was from the publisher he had chosen&mdash;the
Book of John Morning returned.</p>

<p>He was hostile for an instant&mdash;an old vindictive self
resenting this touch upon his gift of self-revelation.
The protecting thought followed quickly that the book
was in no way changed by this accident of encountering
the wrong publisher. The really important part of the
incident followed these insignificant thoughts: Above all
things, this letter would help to prove to Betty Berry his
need for her. He would not send it out again at once.
This refusal would weigh more than anything he could
say, to prove that loneliness had been too much, too
strong for him&mdash;that it had thrown his work out of
reality, instead of into it.... He was bending over
her. A step at the door, and he turned to find Helen
Quiston there.</p>

<p class="ph2">9</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">S</span>he</span> entered and went to the cot, without words, but
pressed his hand as she passed....</p>

<p>“You were there&mdash;and you let her get so low as
this.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span></p>

<p>Helen turned to search his face. “Yes,” she said.</p>

<p>“Who is this&mdash;Guardian?”</p>

<p>“Some angel that came to her, I think.”</p>

<p>“He seems very real to her&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Angels are real.”</p>

<p>“Angels do not make saints suffer&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“On the contrary, that appears to be the life-business
of saints&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“She will never go back to that!” he said with low
vehemence.</p>

<p>Helen regarded her old comrade for a moment, kissed
her reverently, and then turned to the man.</p>

<p>“You poor boy,” she said.</p>

<p>There was something cold and rock-like about this
slave of the future, looking over and beyond the imminent
tragedy. He was helpless, maddened....</p>

<p>“She always said you loved her&mdash;that you were the
one woman absolutely true. How could you let her destroy
herself?”</p>

<p>“I knew her before you came, and loved her. I gave
her my house. I waited upon her night and morning.
I love Betty Berry. You are torn and tortured, but you
will see&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“She will not be away from me again!...
Bah! what is work&mdash;to this?”</p>

<p>Helen smiled. “Do you think she would have come
if she had been the real Betty Berry?”</p>

<p>“Do you think I would have been duped&mdash;had I
been the real John Morning?”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I mean a man is mad when he is doing a book. He
may call it happiness, but it is a kind of devil’s madness.
He is open for anything to rush in.... I am a
common man. I do not belong to that visionary
thing&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You are caught in your emotions. I know your
work&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span></p>

<p>He drew her to the door, saying excitedly:</p>

<p>“<i>Compassion</i> threatens to fail. My book has come
back,” he said triumphantly. “Look at this&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He gave her the publisher’s letter.</p>

<p>“Your play has not failed,” she said.... “And
this&mdash;why, this is just a bit of the world. John Morning
at thirty-three&mdash;talks of failure. Let us talk over this
day, when you are fifty-three.... What an empty
victory for her&mdash;if you failed now&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>She was looking back at the cot. Morning whispered
his reiteration:</p>

<p>“I love her. I shall have her here. I shall make her
see that I love her. <i>That</i> is my service. You are all
mad conspirators against us. We are man and woman.
Our world is each other. She shall see and believe this&mdash;if
I write drivel&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Helen did not seem quite to hear him. She
drew away from him as if called in a trance to
the bedside.</p>

<p>“My little dearest&mdash;oh, Betty Berry&mdash;you have done
so well. You have paid the price for a World-Man&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Morning followed her.... Betty’s eyes were
opened&mdash;fixed upon Helen Quiston.</p>

<p>“What did you say?” she questioned wonderingly.</p>

<p>“God love you, Betty. I said you had paid the price
for a World-Man&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>She raised on her elbow alone, her eyes now looking
beyond the woman to Morning.</p>

<p>“He is there,” she whispered. “He is there. He has
come.”</p>

<p>Her hand stretched toward him, and sank slowly to
his brow as he knelt.</p>

<p>“My love,” she said.... “It is all right. I see
it all once more. It is so good and right&mdash;just as your
Guardian told me.... It was only the birth-pangs
I suffered. They were hard.... Birth is hard,
but death is easy. Don’t you see, Helen, he was my little
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>baby?... Oh, you came so hard, John Morning&mdash;and,
oh, I love you so!”</p>

<p>He saw the fact of her passing, but the deeper realization
was slow. It was much to him, for the instant,
that she spoke and looked into his eyes.</p>

<p>“I love you, Betty Berry,” he said, his voice lifting.
“I love you as a saint, as a mother&mdash;as a child!”</p>

<p>“But not as a woman,” she whispered.</p>

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
